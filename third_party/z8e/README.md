# Z8E Debugger

Z8E is a full-screen symbolic debugger for the Z80 CPU, known from the
former CP/M User Groups.

Main features:

* Screen-oriented.
* Animated debugging.
* Z80 and Z180 versions.
* Auxiliary terminal support.

The current version is 4.2, which fixes an obscure bug that affected reading
of symbol table files that ended exactly at a record boundary without an
explicit end-of-file character (a valid CP/M condition).
