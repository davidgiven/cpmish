I. INTRODUCTION

Z8E is a professional quality interactive debugging tool designed to assist 
in  the testing of assembly language programs for the Z80 and  Z180/HD64180 
processors.

Originally written as a standalone monitor, the Z80 version of Z8E was used 
in the developement of the world's largest Touch-Tone Input/Voice  Response 
system.  Now redone to run in a CP/M or TurboDOS environment  Z8E  contains 
more  features  in  less  memory  than  any  comparable  software  product. 
Occupying just over 9K of memory, Z8E includes the following among its many 
features:

   - Support  for  the Hitachi HD64180 (Z180)  instruction  set.  (Any 
     mention  of  the Z80 in this document can be taken to  imply  the 
     Z180 as well.)

   - Full  screen animated display of the program under test while  it 
     is being executed by the Z80. 

   - Complete Z80 inline assembler, with labels, symbols, expressions, 
     and directives, using Zilog mnemonics

   - Interactive  disassembly with labels and symbols  to  console  or 
     disk allows the user to specify  output formats and add comments 

   - Fully  traced program execution including a full   screen  single 
     step command that instructs Z8E to  disassemble code and to  move 
     the cursor to the  next instruction to execute

   - Up to 16 user settable breakpoints with optional  pass counts

   - True symbolic debugging using the input from  multiple  Microsoft 
     MACRO-80  .PRN and LINK-80  .SYM files and Z80ASM .LST and  SLRNK 
     and Z80ASM .SYM files from SLR Systems. 

   - Dynamic relocation of Z8E at load time to the top  of user memory 
     regardless  of  size.  No  user  configuration  of  any  kind  is 
     required. 

   - Support  for  a  separate  debugging  terminal.   The   debugging 
     activity  can  be run on a terminal attached  to  the  computer's 
     serial port while the application being debugged operates on  the 
     console.

II INSTALLATION

This section describes how to configure and build Z8E for your hardware and 
software environment.

Versions  prior to 4.0 allowed binary patching but that approach  has  been 
abandoned on the premise that it is easier to configure the program at  the 
source code level and reassemble. Anyone who is using a program like Z8E to 
debug at the assembly language level is surely going to have all the  tools 
needed  to perform this task. There is an added advantage. Binary  patching 
leaves  few traces and can be difficult to reproduce when a new version  is 
released but source patches are easy to save and reapply.

The tasks needed to build Z8E from the source are as follows ...
1. Edit Z8E.Z80 to choose the assembler.

Z8E  is written in Zilog mnemonics so Microsoft's M80 or SLR's  Z80ASM  are 
good  choices.  Another candidate is the Cromemco CDOS Z80  Macro Assembler 
which  is available  from  http://www.softsector.hostingsiteforfree.com/cpm 
and  a slightly different but fully functional version is in the  Tesseract 
collection as volume 95.

Without  doing anything, the source will build with Z80ASM so if  you  have 
that  assembler  then  you  can  skip this  step.   (Of  course  other  SLR 
assemblers  which recognise Zilog mnemonics such as SLR180 and Z80ASMP  can 
be used in lieu of Z80ASM.)

The requirements for a different assembler are fairly simple.  It must have 
a  basic macro facility, recognise Zilog mnemonics, be able to  read  input 
from external files and support conditional assembly.

All three assemblers yield .COM files which are bit-for-bit identical.

2. Instruction set and number of terminals

Z8E can debug programs for the Z80 or the Z180 (Hitachi HD64180) and it can 
take  advantage  of a second terminal if one is attached. That  makes  four 
combinations:

 Z80     1 terminal              Z80     2 terminals
 Z180    1 terminal              Z180    2 terminals

Having two terminals is useful when debugging programs which display a  lot 
of  text on the screen. It is convenient to have the debugging session  run 
on  a  second  screen  so  that the  outputs  from  the  debugger  and  the 
application don't tread all over each other.  If you are running CP/M on an 
emulator  such as z80pack or yaze-ag then that second screen might be  just 
another  window on the host computer logically attached to the serial  port 
of the emulated system.

Four little include files, Z8E1.INC, Z8E2.INC, 18E1.INC and 18E2.INC are
included in this distribution.

 Z8E1.INC                Z80 instructions, one terminal
 Z8E2.INC                Z80 instructions, two terminals
 18E1.INC                HD64180/Z180 instructions, one terminal
 18E2.INC                HD64180/Z180 instructions, two terminals

Copy one of those to have the name CONFIG.INC. Look at the file and edit it 
if necessary.

3. Choose or create the terminal handlers

A  few  .TTY files are supplied. Each of these files defines the  code  and 
data specific to a particular terminal. To support a different terminal:
   a)    make a copy of one of the existing files
   b)    edit the copy to match the characteristics of the new terminal
   c)    edit TERMINAL.INC to add new table entries for the new terminal

4. Assemble the program

 SLR:    z80asm z8e/a

 M80:    m80 =z8e.z80
         l80 z8e,z8e/n/e

        ZASMB:  zasmb z8e
                linkb z8e,z8e/n/e

All three assemblers generate identical .COM files.

IMPORTANT: Coding caveat

     Z8E imposes only one restriction on the code you write.  In order 
     to guarantee that your routines can be relocated into high memory 
     by  Z8E  do not load any 16 bit  constants into  register  pairs; 
     instead  do  two  8  bit loads.  For  example,  do  not  use  the 
     following statement:

                         ld     de,1234h

     Rather, code it like this:

                         ld     d,12h
                         ld     e,34h

     With  luck  you  won't  need to load a  constant  into  an  index 
     register  but if you do there are a few ways around the  problem.  
     This  one will work on a Z80 and a Z180, does not depend  on  the 
     assembler  chosen, does not touch any other register and  is  the 
     shortest possible coding:

     Instead of:    ld      ix,5678h            ld      iy,5678h

     code:          defb    0DDh                defb    0FDh
                    ld      h,56h               ld      h,56h
                    defb    0DDh                defb    0FDh
                    ld      l,78h               ld      l,78h

III.  INVOKING Z8E AT THE CP/M COMMAND LEVEL

Upon  invocation at the CP/M command level Z8E loads at the low end of  the 
Transient Program Area (TPA) which begins at absolute address 100h. The TPA 
is the area in memory where user programs are loaded and run.

Once  loaded  Z8E determines the size of the TPA by examining  the  address 
field  of the jump instruction at location 5.  This address represents both 
the  entry point into CP/M and the end of the TPA. Z8E lowers this  address 
by  approximately  9K bytes and relocates into this area by  adjusting  all 
addresses  within itself to reflect its new location. The jump  instruction 
at  location 5 is similiarly modified to reflect the new size of  the  TPA. 
Thus  all  programs  which  use this address to  determine  the  amount  of 
available  memory  can run unchanged. Z8E completes its  initialization  by 
storing  a  jump instruction to its breakpoint handling software  which  is 
normally at absolute address 38 (hexadecimal).

Symbols which are loaded from files are stored by Z8E in a symbol table  at 
the  top  of  the TPA just below Z8E. Z8E  will  dynamically  allocate  the 
storage necessary to hold all symbols loaded from files; however, Z8E  also 
allows  the  user  to  enter his own symbols  from  the  keyboard  via  the 
(A)ssemble  command.  Z8E  does NOT reserve ANY space in  memory  for  user 
generated  symbols.  The user must explicitly request memory space  on  the 
CP/M  command line. This is accomplished by entering the number of  symbols 
for which space should be reserved as a decimal number. This number must be 
enclosed  in  parentheses  and must appear as the  first  argument  on  the 
command line as shown below:

           A>Z8E (32)

In  this example the user has requested space for 32 user defined  symbols. 
If  MAXLEN  has  be set to 6 (See INSTALLATION Section)  then  each  symbol 
requires 8 bytes of storage, hence, in this example Z8E will set aside  256 
bytes of memory for user defined symbols. 

Subsequent  action is based on the format of the remainder of  the  command 
line as entered by the user.  In the examples that follow bear in mind that 
any of these command lines may contain the argument requesting memory space 
for user symbol table entries. The argument would appear immmediately after 
"Z8E" in every case.

     1.    A>Z8E
                
               Z8E resides as a standalone program in memory.

     2.    A>Z8E  USERFILE.COM

               USERFILE.COM is loaded at the beginning of the TPA  and 
               is ready to be acted on by Z8E com mands. 

     3.    A>Z8E  USERFILE.COM USERFILE.SYM [,bias]

               USERFILE.SYM  is read in by Z8E and all  symbol   names 
               contained  in the file are entered into a  table  which 
               begins  at  the starting address of   Z8E  (the  ending 
               address  of  the "new" TPA) and   extends  downward  in 
               memory.  The optional  bias, if specified, is a 16  bit 
               value  which   will  be added to  the  16  bit  address 
               associated   with  each symbol in the  file.  (In  this 
               example  a  .SYM  file is  shown;  however,  since  all  
               addresses  appearing  in a .SYM file are  absolute  the 


                                  - 4 -
        Z8E REFERENCE MANUAL v 4.1 - February 2015


               optional bias would probably not be  used.)

               USERFILE.COM  is loaded at the start of the  TPA   only 
               after the .SYM file has been read and the  symbol table 
               built.  

     4.    A>Z8E  USERFILE.COM  USERFILE.PRN [,bias]

               As  in the previous example USERFILE.COM is  loaded  at 
               the beginning of the TPA, but in  this instance a  .PRN 
               file  is  used  to construct   the  symbol  table.  The 
               optional bias becomes  very useful if the .LST or  .PRN 
               file  represents the listing of a relocatable  program.  
               Relocatable programs linked using Microsoft's   LINK-80 
               default to a load address of 103H with  the three bytes 
               of  memory  located at 100H  containing a jump  to  the 
               entry  point  of the  program. Therefore, if  the  user 
               supplies  a   bias  of  103 in  the  command  line  all 
               relocat-  able symbols in the file will  be  associated  
               with  their  actual  addresses  in  memory.  Any   bias 
               specified  will only be added to those   symbols  which 
               are flagged as code relative in  the .PRN file. A  bias 
               will  not be added to any  symbol flagged as  ABSOLUTE, 
               EXTERANL, OR  COMMON.

               USERFILE.COM  is loaded at the start of the  TPA   only 
               after  the  .LST or .PRN file has been  read   and  the 
               symbol table built.

     5.    A>Z8E USERFILE.COM USERFILE.SYM [,bias] NFILE.LST [,bias]

               The  true  power  of  Z8E's  symbol  loading  is   best  
               evidenced  when  loading multiple symbol  tables   from 
               several files. The first file is generally a .SYM  file 
               specifying all the global  symbol names in the  program 
               to  be tested. The  subsequent files specified  on  the 
               command  line   are usually .PRN or .LST files  of  the 
               individual   source   modules  that   were   originally 
               assembled  and  then linked (which produced  the   .SYM 
               file).  Although only two files (USERFILE   and  NFILE) 
               are  shown in this example the number of .SYM and  .PRN 
               files specified in the command line is limited only  by  
               the size of Z8E's input buffer which is 80   characters 
               long.


               USERFILE.COM  is loaded at the start of the   TPA  only 
               after all .SYM and .PRN/.LST files  have been read  and 
               the symbol table built.

               If no bias is specified, Z8E will use a bias  of zero. 

If more than one .LST or .PRN file is being loaded, then each file name can 
be  specified with its own bias. The bias may be entered in the form  of  a 
symbol name, hexadecimal number, decimal number, or any combinatiion of the 
three  in  an  expression using the + and - operators.  If  the  individual 
module  has a global entry point, the name of which was previously  loaded, 
the user can bias all symbols with the value associated with this name.  In 
this  way all symbols, both absolute and relocatable, are  associated  with 
their actual location in memory.

Z8E  as presently configured can build a symbol table from the  list  files 
produced by the following programs:

    1. Microsoft   MACRO-80    V3.37  .PRN files  May 8, 1980
    2. Microsoft   MACRO-80    V3.44  .PRN files  Dec 9, 1981
    3. Microsoft   LINK-80     V3.44  .SYM files  Dec 9, 1981 
    4. SLR Systems Z80ASM      V1.07  .LST files
    5. SLR Systems SLRNK       V1.07  .SYM files
    6. SLR Systems Z80ASM      V1.3   .PRN files  

Z80ASM and SLRNK may be configured for 80 or 132 column output.

Z8E  uses  the file name extension (the three characters appearing  to  the 
right of the period) to determine the format of the file. Each of the above 
file types has a distinguishing format. The characteritics of each type are 
described in APPENDIX A.
         
During  the loading process Z8E displays status and error messages  on  the 
console  relating  to  the activity in progress  as  shown  below:

     STATUS MESSAGES

     1. Loading: USERFILE.COM

               Z8E  is  attempting to open  the named  file  (in  this  
               case, USERFILE.COM)

     2.  Number of symbols loaded:

               Following  the loading of  all symbols from  a  listing  
               file  or  a .SYM file, the  number  of  symbols  loaded  
               from  the  specified file is  displayed  as  a  decimal  
               number.

     3.   Loaded: 100  YYYY

               Z8E displays the starting Pages: ZZZ and ending  memory 
               addresses of the target file  (the first file specified  
               on  the CP/M command line  and the one which  is  going  
               to be debugged).

               "Pages:" refers to the  decimal number of pages  and is 
               the count of 256  byte pages in the file.  This  number 
               may  subsequently be used with the CP/M   SAVE  command 
               once the debug session ends.

               on the specified drive.

     2.   Symbol table not found

     3.   Invalid offset - using 0000

               The  user has specified an  invalid offset to be  added  
               to each loaded symbol. Z8E  will continue to load  this  
               symbol file but will not  add any bias to the  symbols. 
               This   error  may  have   occured  because   the   user  
               specified an offset in the  form of a symbol which  had  
               not  been  previously  loaded, or the  user  may   have 
               specified a numeric  value which contained an   illegal 
               character.

      4.   Syntax Error

               The file name was incorrectly specified. 

After  all user files, both symbol files and the .COM file to be  debugged, 
have been loaded Z8E displays current memory usage as follows:

     Total Symbols:    XXXX
     Symbol Table:     XXXX - XXXX
     Z8E relocated:    XXXX - XXXX
     Top of memory:    XXXX            

It is important to note that Z8E expects the files appearing in the command 
line to be appear in a specific order. The first file name appearing in the 
command  line is assumed to be the target file which is to be debugged.  It 
is  always the last file to be loaded. All file names following the  target 
file  name are assumed to be symbol input files and they are loaded in  the 
order in which they appear.

The  first  file  named in the command line is always  loaded  starting  at 
address 100 hex. The "I" command contains an option to allow the file to be 
loaded  at a different address. This feature is not available at  the  CP/M 
command line level.

V. INITIALIZATION

Once Z8E has been loaded, and has in turn loaded all files specified on the 
command  line,  it initializes all user registers to 0 with  the  following 
exceptions:

     The user's program counter contains address 100 hex  which is the 
     start of the TPA. 

     The  user's stack pointer is set to the starting address  of  Z8E 
     (the top of the TPA) minus two. These  two bytes are set to  zero 
     in accordance with CP/M  convention. When CP/M loads a program it 
     initializes   a  stack  for the loaded  program  by  pushing  the 
     address   of  the jump to the system warm boot routine  onto  it.  
     Thus  user  programs  (STAT.COM is an  example)  can  choose   to 
     terminate  themselves  and  return to CP/M by  executing  an  RET 
     through  this  address on the stack. Z8E  accomplishes  the  same 
     objective:  the  0000 on the  stack permits the user  program  to 
     return to CP/M via  address 0000 which always contains a jump  to 
     the  system's warm boot routine.  

     The user I (interrupt) register is set to the value  contained in 
     the I register when Z8E was loaded.  Modify at your own risk.

All input and output by Z8E is accomplished using buffers contained  within 
itself. Z8E does not use the default DMA buffer at absolute location 80 nor 
does it use the default File Control Block (FCB) at absolute location 5C. 

     Note:                                           

          When  CP/M finishes loading any program,  including Z8E,  it 
          moves  the command line  tail to the default DMA  buffer  at 
          absolute   address 80 (hex) and initializes the default  FCB 
          at  absolute address 5C to the  name of the first  file  (or 
          first two files  if two or more are specified) appearing  in  
          the  command  line. Z8E makes use of  this   information  in 
          order to load the user  program and any symbol files. If the  
          program  to  be  tested also expects an  ini-  tialized  FCB 
          and/or  DMA  buffer (as is very  often the case),  then  the 
          user  must  effect  this before attempting  to  execute  the  
          program. 

          For  example,  many text editing programs   are  invoked  by 
          typing the name of the  editor program followed by the  name 
          of  the   program to edit on the CP/M command line,   as  in 
          hypothetical case:

                 A>EDIT B:FYL2EDIT.BAS

          Once  the program EDIT.COM is loaded it may  expect to  find 
          the  default  FCB  to be already set up  to  read  the  file  
          FYL2EDIT.BAS.  EDIT.COM may also expect  the DMA  buffer  to 
          contain  the  number of  characters in the command  line  at 
          address   80,  as  well the the text of  the  command   line 
          starting  at address 81. In this example location  80  would 
          contain a hexadecimal F (decimal 15) representing the number 
          of  characters, and locations 81  through 8F  would  contain 
          the 15 characters  (space through S). Similiarly, the  first  
          byte  of  the default FCB at address 5C  would  contain  the 
          number  1 (numeric equi- valent of drive B) and the next  11 
          bytes   would contain the file name FYL2EDIT in   ASCII.  If 


                                  - 8 -
        Z8E REFERENCE MANUAL v 4.1 - February 2015


          the  name FYL2EDIT was shorter  than 8 characters, then  the 
          remainder  of   the  file name field in  the  FCB  would  be  
          filled  with ASCII spaces. The next 3 bytes   would  contain 
          the  file type in ASCII; in  this example the file  type  is 
          BAS.  If  no   file type was  specified,  this  field  would  
          contain 3 ASCII spaces.

          Now  if the user was to debug the EDIT  program  using  Z8E, 
          this  initialisation of  the default DMA buffer and  default 
          FCB  must be accomplished "by hand" prior to  attempting  to 
          debug EDIT.COM owing to the  fact that CP/M has already  set 
          up  these  to be areas with the data from the  command  line  
          which  was  typed in to load Z8E. In short,   EDIT  must  be 
          tricked into believing it was  loaded by CP/M and not by Z8E 
          and  the user must perform the initialization of these   two 
          areas.   The user may use the "I" command to initialize  the 
          default  command  line buffer and FCB.  Further  information  
          regarding the format of the FCB and DMA  buffer may me found 
          in  Digital Research's  CP/M 2.x INTERFACE GUIDE or  in  the 
          CP/M 3 PROGRAMMER'S GUIDE.

V. BREAKPOINTS

Breakpoints are those addresses in the program under test at which the user 
wishes  to suspend execution and return control to Z8E. The user  may  set, 
clear, and display breakpoints at any time, via the appropriate command  in 
response to Z8E's asterisk prompt. Z8E's implementation of breakpoints does 
not  force  the  user to tediously enter breakpoint  addresses  every  time 
execution  is  resumed.  Rather, the user may enter  up  to  16  breakpoint 
addresses and each breakpoint, once set, is stored in one of Z8E's internal 
tables  and remains in effect until explicitly cleared by the user via  the 
Clear breakpoint command (see C command).

Z8E  also  allows  you to specify a pass count to be  associated  with  any 
breakpoint  that  is  set.  Pass counts indicate  the  number  of  times  a 
particular instruction must be executed before Z8E will regain control.

Furthermore,  Z8E does not modify any code in the user program until  a  GO 
command  is issued (see G command). This permits the user to examine  code, 
and make patches if desired, at any point in the debug session.

When  a breakpoint is reached in the user program and Z8E regains  control, 
the  message: *BP*XXXX is displayed where XXXX represents  the  hexadecimal 
address of the breakpoint. In addition, Z8E will display the symbolic  name 
of this address if one exists in the symbol table. Z8E follows this with  a 
display  of  the asterisk prompt indicating it is ready ready  for  command 
processing.

The  message:  *ERROR*BP*XXXX  is displayed on  the  console  whenever  Z8E 
determines that control has been regained without a valid breakpoint having 
been reached. This is generally caused by a user program which has gone off 
the  deep end. If the user examines the current contents of  the  registers 
(via the X command) the current program counter will most assuredly contain 
an  address  which had not previously been set as a breakpoint.  Things  to 
look for when this situation arises include: a program that blew its stack, 
a program that performed a 2 1/2 gainer with a full twist indirect  through 
a  register;  ie. JP (HL) into the great unknown, and attempting  to  trace 
where wise men fear to tread (BIOS and BDOS I/O routines).

Z8E  will allow you to single step (trace) and set breakpoints anywhere  in 
memory.  However,  bear  in  mind  that as you  enter  the  BIOS  and  BDOS 
netherworld  your  stack pointer will at some point be  saved  directly  in 
memory  as CP/M switches to its own stack (your stack pointer is not  saved 
on  a  stack  by  CP/M). If a breakpoint has been  set  at  an  instruction 
somewhere in BDOS or in the BIOS (after this save of your stack pointer has 
occured)  and  this  breakpoint is reached, Z8E will  itself  call  a  BDOS 
routine  in an attempt to display the *BP*XXXX message on the  console.  At 
this point CP/M will save Z8E's stack pointer and overlay yours in  memory. 
When  BDOS  eventually  restores  the stack  pointer  and  executes  a  RET 
instruction you will not return to your program and your stack pointer will 
be gone. These routines can be traced, albeit with difficulty, but you must 
keep an eye on what CP/M is doing with the stack pointer.

As distributed, Z8E uses memory location 38h as its breakpoint vector.   If 
your system software uses 38h for its own purposes or if you are  debugging 
another program which vectors through 38h then you may want to patch Z8E to 
use  a different vector address.  Change the value of RSTVEC to one of  the 
other legal values.  Instructions for doing this are given in section 2.

VI.  COMMAND INPUT

Once  file  and symbol table loading has been completed,  Z8E  prompts  the 
operator  for command input by displaying the "*" character.  The  operator 
can then type any of Z8E's single letter commands. Some commands require no 
arguments  while others require between one and four. Arguments may be  in 
any  of the forms listed below (except as noted in the description  of  the 
individual commands): 

      SYMBOL:       Any   symbol  previously  loaded   or   previously  
                    entered  via  the  keyboard (see  A  command)  may  
                    appear  as  a command argument.  All  symbols  are  
                    treated as 16 bit values.

        HEX:        A  16  bit  hex  number  may  be  entered  as   an  
                    argument.  Only the last four  characters  entered 
                    are  treated  as  significant  input  if  Z8E   is 
                    expecting  a 16 bit argument. In those   instances 
                    where Z8E expects a 8 bit argument,  only the last 
                    two characters are significant.  As such, the user 
                    may   elect   to  correct   mistakes   by   either 
                    backspacing  and  retyping, or  by  continuing  to 
                    enter  the number and ensuring that the  erroneous 
                    digit does not ap- pear in the rightmost four  (or 
                    two) characters as shown in the following example:

                        *E 1E21F4

                    If a 16 bit argument is expected  Z8E would ignore 
                    the first two  digits (1 and E) and would  examine  
                    the contents of memory location  21F4.


                    If  no  symbol  table is present  in  memory  then  
                    hexadecimal numbers (8 or 16 bits in length)   may 
                    begin with any digit 0 - F. However, if  a  symbol 
                    table  is in memory then all  hexadecimal  numbers 
                    which  begin with a digit in the  range A - F  are 
                    evaluated   first   as  symbol    names.   If   no 
                    corresponding  name is found in  the symbol  table 
                    then  Z8E  attempts to re-evaluate the name  as  a 
                    hexadecimal  number. For  example, the token  DEAD 
                    is a valid symbol  names as well as a valid  hexa-
                    decimal number.  If a symbol table is present then 
                    Z8E  first  searches the symbol table looking  for 
                    the   string  DEAD. If no match  occurs  then  Z8E  
                    treats  DEAD as the hexadecimal number 0DEAD.   To 
                    force   Z8E   to  evaluate  an   argument   as   a  
                    hexadecimal  number  prefix the  argument  with  a  
                    leading zero as in 0DEAD. 


     REGISTER:      Valid  Z80 16 bit register names are permitted  as 
                    arguments. If a 16 bit register name  is  entered, 
                    Z8E uses the 16 bit value  currently contained  in 
                    the   specified  register   pair  in  the   user's 
                    register set as an argument.
 
                         *D HL 8

                    instructs  Z8E to dump the first  eight of  memory

                    bytes which are  located at the address  contained 
                    in  the user's HL register pair


                    Valid 16 bit register names:
                              
                              AF - Accumulator and Flag
                              BC - BC register pair
                              DE - DE register pair
                              HL - HL register pair
                              SP - Stack Pointer
                              P  - Program Counter
                              PC - Program Counter
                              IX - IX index register 
                              IY - IY index register

                    Note that the program counter may be specified  in 
                    either  of two ways. The single character "P"  can 
                    be  used to specify the program  counter  provided 
                    it  does not appear in an  expression. To  include 
                    the  current value of  the user's program  counter 
                    in an expression  the mnemonic "PC" must be used.

                    If  an expression used as an argument  contains  a 
                    register  pair as one of its terms,  the  register 
                    pair  must  be  the first  term.  Also,  only  one 
                    register pair may be included in an  expression:

                         HL+4      valid expression

                         5+DE      invalid expression - register 
                                   pair is not the first term

                        HL+BC      invalid   expression   - more 
                                   than  one  register pair  was  
                                   specified

                         P-3       invalid   expression   - "PC" 
                                   must  be used to include  the 
                                   current  value of the program 
                                   counter in an expression

                    To differentiate between the hexadecimal   numbers 
                    AF, BC, and DE and the Z80 register  pairs of  the 
                    same name be sure to prefix the  numerical version 
                    with  a leading 0.  Note also that the  Z80  prime 
                    register  names   are  not  allowed  as  arguments 
                    except in the R  command.

     REGISTER       Z8E allows the user to specify the data  contained
     INDIRECT:      in  the memory location pointed to by a   register 
                    pair as an argument. For instance,  if the  user's 
                    HL register pair contained 18EE  and the addresses 
                    18EE  and  18EF  contained the  bytes  42  and  61 
                    respectively,  then  the  command  *E  (HL)  would 
                    examine  the  contents  of memory  location  6142. 
                    Note that register  indirect memory references are 
                    indicated by  enclosing the register pair name  in 
                    PARENTHESES  which  follows  the  ZILOG   mnemonic 
                    method of signifying "the contents of".

                    The  most useful application of register  indirect 
                    arguments  is  to set breakpoints  at   subroutine 
                    return  addresses.  Consider the  situation  of  a 
                    program  which  is  currently   suspended  via   a 
                    breakpoint   somewhere   in  the   middle   of   a 
                    subroutine.  The  user is  no   longer  interested 
                    debugging  the  body of the  subroutine;  he  only 
                    cares about getting back  to the instruction  that 
                    follows   the   CALL  that   got  him   into   the 
                    subroutine. Register indirect format allows him to 
                    enter:

                                     *B (SP)

                    This  informs  Z8E  to set  a  breakpoint  at  the  
                    address pointed to by the stack pointer  register.


     DECIMAL:       Decimal  numbers  in the range 0 -  65535  may  be  
                    entered  as  arguments. All digits of  the  number 
                    must  be in the range 0-9. A decimal  number  must 
                    be  followed  by a "#" character,   otherwise  Z8E 
                    will  treat  it as a hex  number.   The  following 
                    example  shows  a decimal number  being  input  as 
                    part of the E command:

                         *E 512#  
                      
                              instructs  Z8E  to  examine  memory 
                              location  512 decimal (200 hex)


      LITERAL:      ASCII  literals  up  to 78  bytes  in  length  are  
                    permitted as arguments (Z8E's input buffer is   80 
                    characters  long  less the opening  and   trailing 
                    quote   characters).  ASCII  literals    must   be 
                    enclosed in quotes. The quote character itself  is 
                    the  only character not per- mitted as a  literal. 
                    Commands which do not  permit the use of ARGUMENT-
                    STRINGs (see below) will still accept input in the 
                    form  of  quoted strings. In such a case Z8E  will  
                    ignore  all  but the last two  characters  of  the  
                    quoted  literal, treating the input as a  16   bit 
                    number. For example if the user entered:

                                    *Z 'ABCD'

                    Z8E would treat 'BC' as a 16 bit number and  begin 
                    disassembling at address at 4243.

     ARGUMENT-      The  F  (find), E (examine memory), N  (query  I/O 
     STRINGS:       ports without pre-read), Q (query I/O  ports), and 
                    Y  (fill  memory)  commands  permit   the  use  of 
                    ARGUMENT-STRINGS,  which are simply   combinations 
                    of all valid argument types  separated by  commas. 
                    ARGUMENT-STRINGs  may  be  any length  up  to  the 
                    limit  of  Z8E's input  buffer which is  80  bytes 
                    long. ARGUMENT-STRINGs may be terminated by either 
                    a carriage return or the first space character not  
                    appearing   in  between  quote   characters.   The  
                    following  is an example of a 15  byte   ARGUMENT-


                                  - 13 -

                    STRINGS  string which combines SYMBOLS,  LITERALS, 
                    HEX, and DECIMAL numbers:

                       SYMBOL,'xyZ',4F,12E4,9,21#,511#,'ABc'

                    Assuming  that SYMBOL is equal to 177H  then   the 
                    above ARGUMENT-STRING would evaluate to:  01 77 78 
                    79 5A 4F 12 E4 09 15 01 FF 41 42 63 

                    Again, ARGUMENT-STRINGS are terminated by either a 
                    carriage  return or by the first  space  character 
                    that does not appear in a quoted literal string.

Z8E permits expressions using the + and - operators.  Any argument type may 
be  combined  with any other type.  The length of an expression is  limited 
only  by the size of the input buffer.  Expressions are evaluated from left 
to right and the use of parentheses is not permitted. 

Z8E  indicates argument errors by printing a question mark.

Arguments may be line-edited using the standard CP/M control characters:

               backspace:  erase the last character typed
               control X:  erase the entire line 
               control C:  return to CP/M via warm boot

When  entering  arguments  control-X clears the  argument  list;  a  second 
control-X clears the command line and causes Z8E to reprompt for a command.

All  input  is  truncated to the size of Z8E's input  buffer  which  is  80 
characters long. 

All alphabetic input to Z8E may be in uppercase or lowercase. All output by 
Z8E  follows  the  dictates of the CASE byte as patched by  the  user  (see 
INSTALLATION).

In  this  manual the appearance of square brackets [ ] around  an  argument 
always indicates that the argument is optional.

After  loading  any symbols and the application program Z8E waits  on  ins-
tructions from the operator.  Those instructions comprise  single-character 
commands.   Depending  on the specific command, operands may  be  required.  
Again depending on the command, pressing the 'return' key may be sufficient 
to  continue the command.  When continuation is possible, the general  rule 
is  that 'return' performs it, any other key terminates the  command.

The following pages describe all the commands understood by Z8E.

A    Assemble
_________________________________________________________________


The  A command permits the user to effect inline assembly of Z80  assembler 
source  code, including labels and symbols, using the full Z80  instruction 
set. In addition, the assembler accepts standard Zilog mnemonics  (APPENDIX 
B), expressions using the + and - operators, as well as the following  five 
assembler  directives:  ORG, DEFB, DDB, EQU, and DEFW. The  format  of  the 
command is:

        *A  ARG1  <cr>

          where  ARG1  represents the starting address  at  which 
          assembly will take place

          ARG1 may be of any type


Z8E  initially prompts the user by first disassembling and  displaying  the 
instruction  currently  located at the address specified by ARG1.  This  is 
done as a convenience to permit the user to ensure that any patches will be 
assembled into memory at the intended location. Z8E then outputs a carriage 
return/line feed, displays the address specified as ARG1, and awaits input. 
Z8E  will not disassemble before every line of source code entered  by  the 
user, only before the first one. 


Z8E expects assembler input in the following format:


             LABEL:  opcode  [operand1] [,operand2]


The  label field is always optional, the opcode field is mandatory only  if 
no label was entered, and the operand field must naturally be included  for 
those Z80 instructions which require one. The three fields may be separated 
from one another by spaces or tab characters.

Z8E  does not automatically reserve space within itself for  user  supplied 
symbol names. User supplied symbols, as opposed to those loaded from files, 
are  entered  from  the keyboard in the label field  using  the  (A)ssemble 
command.  Symbol  table space to hold user supplied symbol  names  must  be 
explicitly  requested on the CP/M command line as explained in the  section 
"INVOKING  Z8E at on the CP/M COMMAND LEVEL". These user supplied  symbols, 
once  entered,  may be referenced in the operand field  of  any  subsequent 
assembly  statement  or  in the argument field of any  Z8E  command.  These 
symbols  come  in handy when disassembling .COM files for which  no  source 
listing exists and also when patching code.

The  assembler  is a one pass assembler and forward references  to  symbols 
which  do  not already appear in the symbol table are  flagged  as  errors. 
However,  Z8E  allows the use of the ORG directive (see  discussion  below) 
which allows the user to manipulate the assembler's location counter, which 
helps to minimize the no forward reference limitation.

Labels may begin in any column, but all labels must be followed by a  colon 
even  those appearing in an EQU statement. Labels may be of any length  but 
only the first 6 characters are significant. Z8E always assigns the 16  bit 
value  of  the  assembler's current location counter  to  the  label  being 
entered,  unless  the  statement is an EQU directive. Labels  need  not  be 


                                  - 15 -
        Z8E REFERENCE MANUAL v 4.1 - February 2015


followed  by an opcode and this (as well as the EQU directive)  provides  a 
convenient  way  to  assign  a  value to a  symbol  name.  Merely  set  the 
assemblers  location  counter  (via the ORG directive or  as  ARG1  in  the 
command  line) to the value you wish to assign, then type the  symbol  name 
followed  by  a  carriage return. No object code is produced  and  no  user 
memory  areas  are  modified but the symbol and its  associated  value  are 
entered  into  the user symbol table. Z8E does not treat  duplicate  symbol 
names  as  errors. Rather, if the user enters a symbol name  which  already 
appears  in  the  symbol table, the value associated with  the  new  symbol 
replaces the one associated with the old. For example, if the symbol ENTRYP 
exists  in the symbol table and is associated with the value 23DA  and  the 
user assembles the following instruction:

     41FF 0E 04       ENTRYP: LD C,4

Z8E would replace 23DA with 41FF.

Assembler  statements which do not contain labels may begin in any  column, 
including  column  one. There is NO need to insert a leading space  or  tab 
before an opcode if the opcode is not preceded by a label.

Operands appearing in the operand field of the instruction to be  assembled 
may  be any of the following types subject only to the proviso that 16  bit 
values cannot appear as operand for those Z80 instructions which require  8 
bit values. Expressions combining any of the following four types (with the 
+ and - operators) are also permissible. 

               SYMBOL  (from symbol table)
               HEX
               LITERAL (two bytes maximum)
               DECIMAL


In  addition the dollar sign ($) may also appear in both the operand  field 
of  any instruction in which a 16 bit operand is allowed, and also  in  the 
operand field of any relative jump instruction. The dollar sign  represents 
the current value of the assembler's location counter, that is, the address 
appearing  on the line at which the assembly is taking place.  The  operand 
field of a relative jump instruction can be entered in either of two  ways. 
The  user may code the operand using the dollar sign mentioned above as  in 
the following examples:


          JR  NZ,$+11       ;jump to address PC+11 (hex)     
          
          DJNZ  $-24#       ;jump to address PC-24 (decimal)

The user may alternatively specify a 16 bit value in the operand field of a 
relative  jump instruction and let Z8E calculate the relative  displacement 
from the assembler's program counter as shown below:

          JR    C,LABEL      Assuming LABEL exists, in the symbol  
                             table Z8E will calculate the offset. 
                             LABEL  must  be within +129 or  -126  
                             bytes from the assembler's  location  
                             counter  or  an assembly error  will  
                             result.

          JR      NZ,1080    Z8E  calculates the displacement be- 
                             tween the assembler's current  loca-
                             tion  counter  and the address  1080

                             (hex).
   
Z8E  indicates  error-free input by first displaying the  resultant  object 
code  and  then  displaying (on the next line) the next  address  at  which 
assembly will take place. 

Assembly  errors  are always indicated by a double pair of  question  marks 
which appear following the location counter. An error flag is also  printed 
and will be one of the following:

                ERROR FLAG               MEANING

                    L         Label starts with numeric character
                                 
                    O         Invalid opcode

                    S         Syntax error

                    T         Symbol table full                  

                    U         Instruction references an undefined
                              symbol name

                    V         Value error - a 16 bit  value 
                              was specified as an operand for 
                              an  instruction  which  permits 
                              only 8 bit numbers.

If  an  error  occurs, Z8E will reprompt the user with  the  same  location 
counter address.

As  was  mentioned  previously  the  Z8E  assmebler  uses  standard   Zilog 
mnemonics.  The  one  exception to this is the EX  AF,AF'  instruction.  To 
assemble this instruction the trailing quote character must be omitted.

Z8E supports the ORG directive which allows the user to change the value of 
the  assembly location counter. The operand field of the ORG directive  may 
be  a 16 bit argument of any type. After setting the new assembly  location 
counter Z8E displays the disassembled instruction at the new address.

Z8E  supports  the DEFB, DEFW, and DDB directives which give the  user  the 
ability  to  assemble  data constants into memory.  DEFB accepts an  8  bit 
operand the  value of which  is placed into  memory at the address  of  the 
assembler's current location counter.  DEFW allows the user to specify a 16 
bit operand value, the low order byte of which is placed into memory at the 
address  of the assembler's current location counter, while the high  order 
byte of the operand is placed into memory at the address of the assembler's 
current location counter plus one. This is in accordance with the  8080/Z80 
convention  of storing the high order byte of 16 bit data toward  the  high 
end  of memory. The DDB (define double byte) directive allows the  user  to 
specify a 16 bit value which, in contrast to the DEFW directive, is  stored 
in memory with the high order byte toward the low end of memory. That is, a 
DDB  directive instructs Z8E to store the most significant byte of  the  16 
bit  operand  value  in memory at the address of  the  assembler's  current 
location counter, and the least significant (low order) byte is placed into 
memory at the address of the assembler's current location counter plus one. 

The  EQU  directive allows the user to assign a value to a symbol.  An  EQU 
directive  does  not  generate object code. It merely allows  the  user  to 
reference  a  numeric  value  by a symbolic  name  in  subsequent  assembly 
statements or monitor commands. It is especially useful when used prior  to

disassembling  (see Z command) code for which no symbol table  exists.  The 
EQU  directive  requires the user to supply a symbolic name  in  the  label 
field  of the instruction. If Z8E indicates errors in an EQU  statement  by 
printing question marks. If an EQU statement is correctly assembled by Z8E, 
the address of the assembler's current location counter is erased since  an 
EQU  statement  generates  no  object  code.  Operands  appearing  in   EQU 
statements  are evaluated to a 16 bit value. Z8E will display the value  of 
this  16  bit  number as four hex digits in the object code  field  on  the 
console.

B    Set Breakpoint
_________________________________________________________________


Breakpoints  are  those  addresses  at which the  user  wishes  to  suspend 
execution of the program under test. Breakpoints may be set at any time  in 
response  to  Z8E's asterisk prompt. Z8E allows the user to set  up  to  16 
individual breakpoints in his program. Z8E also allows the user to  specify 
a  pass count to be associated with any breakpoint. The command is  invoked 
as follows:


     *B ARG1[,pass count] [ARG2... ARGn] <cr>

          where each argument represents the address in the  user 
          program at which a breakpoint is to be set 

Normally,  that  is when no pass count is specifed, execution of  the  user 
program  stops  and control returns to the Z8E command level as soon  as  a 
breakpoint is reached. Pass counts are used to inform Z8E that execution of 
the user program should halt only when the specified breakpoint is  reached 
the number of times times indicated by the pass count. 

Pass counts are specified by following the breakpoint address with a  comma 
and then entering a pass count immediately following the comma.

An  existing pass count may be changed to a different value  by  reentering 
the same breakpoint address, following it with a comma, and then specifying 
the  new pass count. To break on a multi-byte Z80 instruction  the  address 
specified  as the breakpoint address must be that of the first byte of  the 
instruction. Users who fail to observe this rule will generally find  their 
programs hopping the next bus to never-never land. If a patch is made at an 
address of a breakpoint currently in effect be sure the breakpoint  address 
is still pointing at the first byte of the new instruction. 

Multiple breakpoints may be set with the same B command by separating  each 
one  with  a single space. If multiple breakpoints are  specified  and  Z8E 
detects  an  erroneous  argument  (a non-existent  symbol  for  example)  a 
question  mark  will  be printed, and the  command  terminates.  All  valid 
breakpoints specified up to the invalid one will be set. 

Z8E  displays a question mark when a attempt is made to set  a  seventeenth 
breakpoint.

C    Clear Breakpoint
_________________________________________________________________


The C command clears individual breakpoints previously set by a B  command. 
The format of the command is:


          *C  ARG1 [ARG2...ARGn] <cr>

               where each arg may be any valid argument type 
               which  evaluates to an address previously set 
               as a breakpoint


Multiple  breakpoints  may be cleared by the same C command  by  separating 
each argument with a single space.

Z8E  displays  a  question mark when an attempt is made  to  clear  a  non-
existent breakpoint.

To clear ALL breakpoints enter: *C * where the asterisk indicates ALL.

D    Dump
_________________________________________________________________


The D command allows the user to dump memory in both hexadecimal and  ASCII 
to the console in user specified block sizes. The format of the command is:

          *D  [ARG1]  [ARG2]  <cr>

               where    ARG1 =  the starting address to dump
                        
                        ARG2 =  dictates the dump format  depending on 
                                its value. If ARG2  is in the range  0 
                                -  255 then it  is treated as a  block 
                                size  and   represents the  number  of 
                                bytes  to  be displayed (0 is  treated 
                                as  256). If ARG2 is greater than  255  
                                then  ARG2  is treated  as  an  ending  
                                address  and  memory  will  be  dumped  
                                non-interactively to the console.

               ARG1 and ARG2 may be of any argument type.

If ARG1 is omitted then the dump resumes from the last memory address+1  as 
displayed  via the previous invocation of the D command. If no  previous  D 
command had been given then memory is dumped starting at address 100H.

If  ARG2  is omitted then the most recent value of ARG2 (from  the  last  D 
command)  is  used.  The dump command displays the contents  of  memory  in 
hexadecimal  on the left side of the console while the ASCII equivalent  of 
each byte is shown on the right side. 

During  a block by block dump (ARG2 < 256 signifies a block by block  dump) 
Z8E  waits for user input after each block is displayed. A carriage  return 
entered  by  the  user  causes the command to  terminate  while  any  other 
character causes the next sequential block to be dumped.

For non-interactive dumps, starting address to ending address, pressing any 
key terminates the dump.

The dump command provides an especially easy way of examining tabular data, 
for  example in scanning the disk parameter headers in your BIOS. That  is, 
by specifying the base address as ARG1 and the table size as ARG2 the  user 
can walk through memory, table by table.

E    Examine Memory
_________________________________________________________________


The E command allows the user to examine and optionally modify the contents 
of memory. The format of the command is:

     *E   ARG1  <cr>

               where  ARG1 is the address of the first byte  to 
               examine

               ARG1 may be any symbol type 

Upon  receipt  of ARG1 Z8E will read the contents of the  specified  memory 
address and display the byte in both hex and ASCII. At this point the  user 
has  two  options. The user may specify replacement data to be  written  to 
memory  starting  at the current address, or he may choose to  continue  to 
passively  examine  memory. The choice is determined  by  the  character(s) 
which are input after the contents of an address are displayed. 

If the user wishes to modify memory starting at the current memory address, 
then  an ARGUMENT-STRING may be entered following the displayed  byte.  Z8E 
will  evaluate the entire string and write the evaluated equivalent of  the 
string  into consecutive memory locations starting with the current  memory 
address. For example the user could enter the following ARGUMENT-STRING: 

     *E 45F9
     45F9  42  B  'This is a string',0D,0A,13,4F,9,'More Text',05
                  ^                                             ^  

                  The user input apprears between the arrows  and 
                  would be evaluated to the following 31 bytes: 
                    
                  54 68 69 73 20 49 73 20 61 20 73 74 72 69 6E 67 
                  0D 0A 13 4F 09 4D 6F 62 65 20 74 65 78 74 05  

                  These  31  bytes  would be stored  into  memory 
                  locations  45F9  to 4617 and the  next  address 
                  displayed on the screen would be 4618.

     4618  23  #

Remember  that  ARGUMENT-STRINGS  may be terminated by  either  a  carriage 
return  or by the first space character which does not appear in  a  quoted 
literal string. The choice of terminator determines the which address  will 
be displayed next. If a carriage return is used to terminate the  ARGUMENT-
STRING,  then  Z8E  will display the next sequential  memory  address.  For 
example:

          *E 1002
          1002  45  E  12,8F,00 <cr>
          1005  28  (

The  user  entered  an ARGUMENT-STRING 12,8F,00 which was  evaluated  to  3 
bytes.  Since the ARGUMENT-STRING was terminated by a carriage  return  the 
next address displayed was 1002+3 or 1005. 

By  terminating  the ARGUMENT-STRING with a space the user can  verify  the 
contents  of memory just modified.  ARGUMENT-STRINGS terminated by a  space 
cause  Z8E  to  redisplay the starting address; this makes  the  data  just

          *E 1002
          1002  45  E  12,8F,00  <space>
          1002  12  ~

If the user does not want to write any data to the current memory  address, 
then  the character entered should be a space character, up  arrow  (caret) 
character, or a carriage return.

                  CHARACTER                     ACTION
               
                    space          read next sequential memory address 
                    
                  up arrow         read previous memory address

The  user may also change the current memory address by entering  an  equal 
sign  "=" followed by a valid argument. The address obtained by  evaluating 
this argument becomes the new current memory address as shown below: 

     *E 1344

F    Find
_________________________________________________________________


The find command allows the user to search memory for multi-byte strings in 
memory. The format of the command is:

     *F   ARG1  ARG2 <cr>

          where  ARG1  =  the starting address at which to begin   the 
                          search, it may be of any type.
                 ARG2 =   is   an  ARGUMENT-STRING  representing   the  
                          pattern to search for; the user may  specify 
                          any  combination of arguments  separated  by 
                          commas  or spaces up to the  limit of  Z8E's 
                          command line buffer  which is 80 bytes long. 
                          The  actual   number of bytes  searched  for 
                          depends  on   how the string  is  ultimately 
                          evaluated.

                              
Z8E  will  display  every address which contains data  matching  ARG2.  The 
search continues until the end of memory is reached.

The  user may elect to cancel the search at any time by depressing any  key 
on the keyboard.

If ARG2 is a single argument (as opposed to an argument string) and if this 
argument is a symbol name then Z8E will reverse the order of the two  bytes 
comprising  the  16  bit operand. Most 16 bit values in  Z80  programs  are 
stored  with  the least significant byte at a given address  and  the  most 
significant  byte at the given address+1 (toward the high end  of  memory). 
This  is  in  accordance  with  the Z80  convention  of  storing  the  most 
significant byte of a 16 bit argument toward the high end of memory.

The following are examples of the FIND command:

     *F 0 SYMBOL

     Assuming  that  the symbol "SYMBOL" is associated with   the  hex 
     value 3BF then Z8E would attempt to find all  address  containing 
     the byte pair BF and 03 in that  order, with the search beginning 
     at  address  0000.  Note   that the order of  the  two  bytes  is 
     reversed because the  symbol "SYMBOL" exists in the symbol table. 
     To  search   for the byte pair 03 and BF in that order  the  user  
     should enter the argument as either a 16 bit hex number  (3BF) or 
     as two 8 bit hex numbers (03,BF). 


     *F 100 87,32#,'ABCD',0C3,symbol,'p',271F

     Assuming  that  the symbol "symbol" is associated  with  the  hex 
     value 3BF then Z8E would attempt to find all  starting  addresses 
     of the following 12 byte string:

             87 20 41 42 43 44 C3 03 BF 70 27 1F

     Notice  that Z8E would search for the two byte pattern  03 BF  as 
     the  value  for "symbol". If the user happened  to be  trying  to 
     find the instruction JP symbol  the search would fail because  as 
     mentioned  above 16 bit  values are stored low order byte  first.

     The user  should have entered C3 BF 03.

     The  two  bytes which represent the address of  symbol  are   not 
     reversed as in the example above because ARG2 is  specified as an 
     ARGUMENT-STRING as opposed to a single  argument.

     Z8E would begin its search at address 100 (ARG1).

G    Go
_________________________________________________________________


The  G  command  instructs Z8E to begin or resume  execution  of  the  user 
program. The format of the command is:

          *G   [ARG1]  <cr>

               where      ARG1   =   the  address  of  the  first 
                                     instruction the user wishes
                                     to execute.

               ARG1  may be any argument type.   If omitted  then 
               the current program counter value is assumed.


Upon  receipt of this command Z8E initializes all breakpoints in  the  user 
program,  restores  all user registers, and transfers control to  the  user 
program  under test at the address specified in ARG1. Execution within  the 
user program will continue until the user program reaches a breakpoint,  at 
which  point control will return to Z8E. This is the only way the  user  is 
able to return control to Z8E once the GO command is issued.

Z8E breakpoint technique has been designed such that Z8E will not  directly 
initialize a breakpoint at the address specified in ARG1. In actualiity  it 
would  be  impossible  to do so since an attempt would be  made  to  resume 
execution  at  this  address,  a breakpoint would have  been  set  at  this 
address,  and control would immediately return to the monitor without  this 
instruction  ever having been executed.  This limitation has been  overcome 
in Z8E by actually copying the single instruction located at ARG1 to  Z8E's 
memory,  THEN  setting  the breakpoint at the  ARG1  address,  and  finally 
executing  the  "moved" version of the instruction in Z8E's  memory  rather 
than  in the user program. Z8E compensates for the that CALL  and  RELATIVE 
JUMP  instructions are affected by the address at which they are  executed. 
This entire process is totally transparent and it allows the user to  debug 
loops  by  setting  only a single breakpoint within the range  of  a  loop, 
obviates the need to clear any breakpoints which are located at the address 
where  execution  is  to resume, and even allows breakpoints at  a  DJNZ  $ 
instructions!


HINT:
     When proceeding from a breakpoint it is simplest to use  the 
     parameterless  form of the GO command:  *G <cr> which  tells 
     Z8E  to  resume  execution at the address specified  by  the 
     user's current program counter.

H    Display Symbol Table
_________________________________________________________________


The H command allows the user to view the symbol table on the console.  The 
format of the command is:

          *H   [ARG1]  <cr>

               where ARG1 must be a symbol name


If  ARG1 is omitted Z8E will display the entire symbol table starting  with 
the  first  symbol  in the table. If ARG1 is present  Z8E  will  begin  the 
display with that symbol. Z8E displays a block of 32 symbols then waits for 
user  input.  If  the  user  enters a  carriage  return  then  the  command 
terminates.  If  the user enters any other character the next block  of  32 
symbols is displayed.

If  a symbol name entered as ARG1 cannot be found in the symbol  table  Z8E 
prints a question mark.

I    Initialise FCB and command tail
_________________________________________________________________


The I command initializes the command tail at 80h and the file name  fields 
in the default FCB (5Ch and 6Ch).

          *I  [ARG1] [ARG2] ... [ARGn] <cr>

               where each arg may be any string.

The command tail in the default DMA buffer at 80h will be filled in with  a 
standard  format  command buffer comprising a length byte followed  by  the 
string formed by translating all the ARGs to upper case. A zero is appended 
after the last ARG.

The  first two ARGs are treated as (possibly ambiguous) file names and  are 
copied  with appropriate padding into the file name fields in  the  default 
FCB area.

If no ARG2 is present then the file name field at 6Ch will be  blank-filled 
from 6Dh to 77h. If no ARG1 is present then the file name field at 5Ch will 
be blank-filled from 5Dh to 67h.

Since  the "I" command with no arguments is a valid command, it  cannot  be 
aborted.

Note  that  Z8E does not automatically insert a space at the  head  of  the 
command  tail. If you are debugging routines to parse the command line  you 
should  insert a tab or space yourself to make the command tail  realistic. 
For example, the Z8E command:

                 i   square.peg

generates the command tail:

       0A 53 51 55 41 52 45 21 50 45 47 00
       10  S  Q  U  A  R  E  .  P  E  G 00

whereas the command tail to program 'fit' generated at the CP/M level by:

                 fit square.peg

would be:

       0B 20 53 51 55 41 52 45 21 50 45 47 00
       11     S  Q  U  A  R  E  .  P  E  G 00

and  you can emulate this form by putting the space in yourself before  the 
word 'square'.

J    Animated Full Screen Debugger
________________________________________________________________

The J command provides the user with the ability to "see" inside the Z80 as 
it  executes a program. The Z8E animated debugger allows the user  to  view 
registers,  memory,  and  instructions  while  the  Z80  is  simultaneously 
executing code. In addtion the J command provides the user with the ability 
to  interactively  single-step  through a program  using  the  full  screen 
facilities of the command. The format of the J command is:

     *J   [/] [*] [ARG1] [ARG2]
or   *J   #

          USE  OF THE J COMMAND FOR SINGLE STEPPING IS   DESCRIBED  AT 
          THE  END OF THIS SECTION. THIS  SECTION DESCRIBES  THE  NON-
          INTERACTIVE VERSION OF  THE J COMMAND DURING WHICH THE  USER 
          TURNS OVER  COMPLETE CONTROL OF THE EXECUTION OF THE PROGRAM  
          UNDER TEST TO Z8E. 

          ARG1  is the starting address of the display and  may be  of 
          any valid argument type. For example,  the user may  specify 
          *J  P  to  resume  execution  at  the  point  where  it  had 
          previouly been stopped. 

          The slash and star control subroutine tracing as  follows:

               "/"  Slash  informs  Z8E not to trace any  subrou-
                    tines at all.
         
               "*"  Asterisk informs Z8E not to trace any subrou-
                    tine  calls to addresses located in the range 
                    0 to FF.  This feature is intended to  screen 
                    out  calls  to location 5 (BDOS) in order  to 
                    prevent  Z8E's  and  the  user's  stack  from 
                    becoming hopelessly entangled.
               
          ARG2 represents an optional timeout paramter which   affects 
          the  speed at which instructions are executed.  This  number 
          may  be  in  the range 0 - 255,  with 10  (decimal)  as  the 
          default  if  no  value is  entered. A timeout  value  of  10 
          yields  approximately  a one half second delay  between  the 
          execution    of  sequential  instructions.  A  value  of   0 
          represents  NO  time delay and is in actuality  the  fastest 
          rate a which the J command can run.

Once the J command commences, Z8E takes over the Z80 and furnishes the user 
with  a "peephole" into the CPU. Z8E executes one instruction at a time  in 
the  user program pausing after each one to dynamically update  the  screen 
display.  The J command divides the screen into three areas: register  map, 
disassembled  code,  and  memory window.  The  register  map  displays  all 
registers on the top two lines of the screen along with the contents of the 
F  register  which  is shown in mnemonic form.  Z8E  also  disassembles  18 
instructions based on the current PC value and displays them on the screen; 
finally,  using  the parameters entered in the W command, Z8E  snapshots  a 
block of memory and displays it as a window on the screen. 

Execution  of the user program continues until any non-numeric key  on  the 
keyboard  is pressed which ends the command. If a numeric key  is  pressed, 
then  Z8E responds by changing the timeout parameter on the fly.  The  user 
may  use the keys 0 - 9 as a throttle to govern the execution  speed.  Zero 
being the fastest; nine being the slowest.

        Z8E REFERENCE MANUAL v 4.1 - February 2015



The command also terminates whenever a user defined breakpoint is  reached. 
That  is,  if  the user had set a breakpoint via the  B  command  and  this 
address is reached the J command ends and Z8E prompts the user for the next 
command.  If the breakpoint had a pass count associated with it,  the  pass 
count must reach zero before the J command will terminate.

USING THE J COMMAND FOR SINGLE STEPPING

Z8E  permits  the user to single-step through a program  while  allowing  a 
continuous full-screen view of the registers, code being executed, and  the 
contents  of a block of memory as specified by the K command. In  order  to 
invoke the full screen single-step the user enters the following command:

     *J   [/]  [*] 

          / instructs Z8E not to trace any subroutines  at all

          * instructs Z8E not to trace any subroutines  location below 
          address 100H and is  specifically designed to allow the user 
          the  option of not becoming tangled in BDOS and  BIOS.

          Note  that this version of the J command is   differentiated 
          from  the  non-interactive  version by the  absence  of  any 
          argument indicating an execution address. 

This version allows the user to execute one instruction in his program  and 
then  regain  control  at  the Z8E command  level.  Z8E  will  execute  the 
instruction  pointed to by the user's current PC. After the instruction  is 
executed an ARROW ( => ) points to the next instruction to be executed.

The  / and * options are only valid if the next instruction to be  executed 
is a CALL. If the program counter is pointing at any other instruction then 
the / and * have no immediate effect.  However the meaning is remembered so 
that when a CALL instruction is encountered the appropriate action (or non-
action) will be taken.

After  a J command has been issued pressing <cr> is equivalent  to  issuing 
another J command.  This allows you to manually step through a program very 
quickly.

REFRESHING THE SCREEN

Z8E's  orderly display can be disturbed by console output generated by  the 
program being debugged.  If that happens then use command form *J  #     to 
refresh the screen.  No other argument is permitted.

K    Set Memory Window Parameters for use With the J command
________________________________________________________________

The K command sets the starting address and block size of the memory window 
display during the J command. The format of the command is:

          *K  ARG1 [,ARG2]

          ARG1  represents  the starting address  of  the  memory 
          block.

          ARG2 is an optional size paramter, if omitted the block 
          size defaults to the maximum.

The maximum block size is 144 decimal which is 90 hex. The starting address 
of  the  memory  block can be anywhere in memory; it does not  have  to  be 
within the confines of the user program.

L    Load file
_________________________________________________________________


The  L command allows the user to load files into the TPA after  the  debug 
session has started. The format of the command is:

     *L   ARG1[,ARG2]  <cr>

               ARG1  is a single unambiguous file name  conforming  to 
               standard  CP/M  syntax rules:

            -  optional  drive name followed by a colon   -  mandatory 
               primary file name

            -  optional secondary file name preceded by a  period 

               ARG2  is  an  optional load address.  If  ARG2  is  not  
               specified the named file is loaded at the start of  the 
               TPA (address 100 hex). If ARG2 is given the  file  will 
               be  loaded  at  this address. Z8E  will  NOT   relocate 
               individual  addresses within the file to   reflect  the 
               new load address. ARG2 may be of any  type.

               NOTE:  If  no arguments are entered then Z8E  will 
                      redisplay the starting address,  ending ad-
                      dress,  and the number of 256 byte pages of 
                      the last file loaded.  


If  Z8E detects a error in the file name specification the message  "Syntax 
error" is printed on the console and the command terminates.

If  Z8E  is unable to locate the file on the specified  drive  the  message 
"File not found" is printed on the console and the command terminates.

Z8E  contains  no facilties for converting .HEX (Intel Hex  format)  object 
files  to loadable memory image. All files, regardless of type, are  loaded 
into  memory  in exactly the same form as they appear on disk. To  debug  a 
and  save  the file with the CP/M SAVE command which produces  an  absolute 
memory  image  load-able by Z8E. All .COM files are of  course  already  in 
loadable form and no LOADing and SAVEing is required.

If the file will not fit into the TPA, Z8E will print the message:

     Out of memory - Continue?

If  the user answers "Y", Z8E will resume loading the file at  address  100 
hex  if ARG2 was not entered, or at the address specified as ARG2.  If  the 
user  types  any  other response, the loading process  terminates  and  Z8E 
returns to the command level. However, the user may resume loading the file 
at  a later time by issuing the L command and specifying the file name  "." 
(a  single  period).  The user may choose to specify a  new  starting  load 
address  following  the period; if ARG2 is omitted then  the  load  address 
defaults  back to 100 hex, the start of the TPA. If the user has  done  any 
subsequent  disk I/O (such as loading a new file of disassembling to  disk) 
in  between  the time loading was suspended and then  restarted,  Z8E  will 
treat the file name "." as a syntax error. 

The  user may occasionally need to overlay a section of code in  a  program 
which already resides in memory with input from a file on disk, for example 


                                  - 32 -
        X  file the user should first load the file with the CP/M  LOAD  command 


in modifying a BIOS in preparation for MOVCPM. While this is possible  with 
loaders  which process .HEX object files, it is not feasible with Z8E.  The 
user  can circumvent this limitation by loading the file from disk into  an 
unused section of memory and then using Z8E's move command to move only the 
data needed to accomplish the overlay.

M    Move Memory
_________________________________________________________________


The  M command allows the user to move blocks of date from any  address  in 
memory to any other address in memory. The format of the command is:

          *M   ARG1  ARG2  ARG3  

               where   ARG1  =  the   starting  address  of   the 
                                source data block        
                       
                       ARG2  =  the  ending address of the source 
                                data block

                       ARG3  =  the   starting  address  of   the 
                                destination data block   


                                arguments may be of any type

Z8E  automatically decides whether a head-to-head or tail-to-tail  move  is 
required  based on the three arguments entered. If a head-to-head  move  is 
needed then the first byte of the source data block will be written to  the 
first  byte position of the destination data block; the second byte of  the 
source  data  block  will be written to the second  byte  position  of  the 
destination  data  block,  and  so  on until  the  ending  address  of  the 
destination data block is reached. 

On  the other hand, if a tail-to-tail move is necessary Z8E will  move  the 
last  byte  of  the  source data block to the last  byte  position  of  the 
destination  data block, followed by the second to last byte of the  source 
data  block  to the second to last byte position of  the  destination  data 
block,  and  so on until the starting address of the destination  block  is 
reached. 

A tail to tail move would be necessary in the following example to  prevent 
the overwriting of the destination data block:

          *M  1000 100F 1008

N    Output to I/O Ports rithout pre-read
_________________________________________________________________

This  command allows the user to output data to an I/O port  without  first 
reading  the port (as occurs in the Q command). The format of  the  command 
is:

     *N   [ARG1]

          where  ARG1  is the port number to which the  data  will  be 
          written.

          If  ARG1  is omitted then Z8E uses the   last  port  address 
          which had been  input by a previous N or Q command. 

Z8E will prompt the user by displaying the current port number on the  left 
hand  side  of  the console and postioning the cursor two  spaces  the  the 
right. At this point the user can enter the data to be sent to the port  in 
the form of an ARGUMENT-STRING. The ARGUMENT-STRING allows the user to  mix 
various  argument  types  such as hex data and ASCII  literal  strings.  Of 
course  the user can elect to merely output single bytes if desired. The  N 
command  is  particularly useful when programming  various  Z80  peripheral 
chips  such as the DMA and SIO chips which expect initialization  bytes  to 
arrive in a stream without intervening reads.

          *N 80
          80  'T',00,12#,998

          This  ARGUMENT-STRING would be evaluated into the  5  bytes: 
          54  00 0C 09 98. These five bytes would  be sent to port  80 
          via an OTIR instruction. No  delay occurs between successive 
          bytes. 

After the data has been entered and after it has been sent to the I/O  port 
Z8E  reprompts the user by displaying the same port number. This gives  the 
user  to oppportunity to send addtional data to the same port. However,  by 
not entering data the user can change the current port address by  entering 
any of the following:

        CARRIAGE    The next sequential port number in  ascending 
         RETURN     order becomes the current port address.

        UP ARROW    The next sequential port number in descending 
                    order becomes the current port address.

         =ARG       Any argument appearing immediately after  the  
                    equal   sign  (no  intervening   spaces)   is 
                    evaluated as an 8 bit number, and if found to 
                    be   valid  then it becomes the  new  current 
                    port  address. 

        PERIOD      Terminate command

The  user can also monitor an I/O port with the N command by enclosing  the 
port  number  on the command line in parentheses.  Monitor mode via  the  N 
command is identical to that of the Q command (see Q command).

In Z180 mode the N and Q commands support access to the HD64180's internal I/O 
registers.

When  writing to a Z180/HD64180 port, Z8E first clears the B register,  places

the port number in the C register, points HL to a buffer internal to Z8E  con-
taining the data to be written and then executes an OUTI instruction. 

This method ensures that A8 to A15 are at 0 when the N command is accessing an 
I/O port.

O    Output Current Breakpoints to Console
_________________________________________________________________


The O command allows the user to view all breakpoints currently in  effect. 
The format of the command is:

          *O  

               no arguments are required

If  Z8E finds a symbol name corresponding to the absolute hex address of  a 
breakpoint address in the symbol table (if a symbol table exists) then  the 
symbol  name  as  well as the memory address is  displayed.  If  no  symbol 
corresponding to the address is found only the hex address is displayed. 

If  any pass counts are currently in effect they are displayed next to  the 
breakpoint address with which they are associated.

P    Examine/Modify PSW (Flag Register)
_________________________________________________________________


The  P  command provides a convenient method of  examining  and  optionally 
modifying  the F(lag) register in the user register set. The format of  the 
command is:

     *P

          no arguments are required on the command line

Upon  receipt of the P command Z8E displays the mnemonics corresponding  to 
the  current  state of the four user-modifiable bits  (sign,  carry,  zero, 
parity) in Flag register:


     MNEMONIC            MEANING             BIT STATUS

        P                positive               reset
        M                 minus                  set

        NC               no carry               reset
        C                 carry                  set

        PO              parity odd              reset
        PE              parity even              set

        NZ               not zero               reset
        Z                  zero                  set 


Z8E  prints the mnemonic corresponding to the current state of each of  the 
four flag bits. Z8E then issues a carriage return/line feed and pauses  for 
user  input.  The user may modify any of the four flag bits by  typing  the 
appropriate  mnemonic  followed by a carriage return. The  user  may  enter 
multiple mnemonics by separating each one with a space. 

If  no  mnemonics are entered, no flags bits are altered  and  the  command 
terminates.

If an invalid flag bit mnemonic is entered Z8E prints a question mark.

Q    Query I/O Ports
_________________________________________________________________

The Q command allows the user flexible access to I/O ports by providing the 
ability to perform single byte input, continuous input (monitor mode),  and 
single or multi-byte output following a pre-read of the port. The format of 
the command is:

     *Q [(] [ARG1] [)]

          where ARG1 is an 8 bit port address in the range 0 - 255

          ARG1  may  be  any  symbol type,  however if a 16  bit  value  is 
          specified only the low order byte is  significant 

          If no argument is given Z8E will use the most  recent port number 
          as entered by the user via an N  or Q command.

          If ARG1 is enclosed in parentheses Z8E will enter  MONITOR MODE.

Upon  receipt of ARG1 Z8E will read the specified I/O port and display  the 
byte  read  as  both 8 bit hexadecimal value  and  it's  ASCII  equivalent. 
Command options once a byte has been read from the I/O port are as follows:

     SINGLE BYTE INPUT

          By  entering  a SPACE immediately following  the   displayed 
          contents  of  the  I/O port the user can   instruct  Z8E  to 
          continue reading from the same  I/O port:

                       *Q EE
                       EE   24  $  <space>
                       EE   24  $

          By  entering  a  CARRIAGE  RETURN  following  the  displayed 
          contents of the I/O port the user can  instruct Z8E to  read 
          the next port number  (ascending order):

                       *Q EE
                       EE   24  $  <cr>
                       EF   C1  A

          By entering a caret "^" following the displayed  contents of 
          the I/O port the user can instruct  Z8E to read the previous 
          port number (descending  order):

                       *Q EE
                       EE   24  $  ^  (up arrow entered by user)
                       ED   06  ~                       

          By entering an equal sign "=" followed by a valid  argument, 
          the user can switch to reading a new  port address:

                       *Q EE
                       EE   24  '$'  =90 
                       90   BF  '?'             


     CONTINUOUS INPUT (MONITOR MODE)

          Z8E provides the user with the ability to monitor  an  input

        X  file the user should first load the file with the CP/M  LOAD  command 


          port. Z8E will continously read the  selected input port and 
          display  the contents on  the screen. Z8E displays the  byte 
          in  both  hex   and binary. This feature is  useful  in  the  
          testing  of I/O ports. Depressing any key on  the   keyboard 
          exits monitor mode. 

     MULTI-BYTE OUTPUT 

          Following  the  read of an I/O port the user may   elect  to 
          output  data. The user may enter an   ARGUMENT-STRING  which 
          will  be sent to the port on  a byte by byte basis  with  no 
          intervening reads  between outputs as shown below:

                *Q 50
                50  44  'D' 23,9,'B2E',00,F723,81
                            ^                   ^
                            string  as entered by 
                            user appears  between 
                            arrows

          The data as entered by the user in this example  would first 
          be converted to the 9 bytes shown  below:

               23 09 42 32 45 00 F7 23 81

          These 9 bytes would then be sent to port 50 one  byte  after 
          another without any intervening reads  or status checks.

When  in Z180/HD64180 mode Z8E's N and Q commands perform just as they  do  in 
Z80 mode except that they support access to the HD64180's internal I/O  regis-
ters.

When  reading  an I/O port, Z8E first clears the B register, places  the  port 
number in the C register and then executes an IN A,(C) instruction. 

When writing to an I/O port, Z8E first clears the B register, places the  port 
number in the C register, points HL to a buffer internal to 18E containing the 
data to be written and then executes an OUTI instruction. 

This method ensures that A8 to A15 are held at 0 when the N or Q commands  are 
accessing an I/O port.

R    Examine/Modify Register Contents
_________________________________________________________________


The  R command allows the user to examine and optionally  modify  registers 
and register pairs in the user register set. The format of the command is:

          *R   ARG1  <cr> or space

               where  ARG1  is any of the 22  register  mnemonics 
               listed below:

                     A    B    C    D    E    H    L
                     AF   BC   DE   HL   IX   IY   SP
                     AF'  BC'  DE'  HL'  I    R    P    PC

                    (the  program  counter may  be  specified  as 
                    either P or PC)

To  examine  a  register the user enters a mnemonic  from  the  above  list 
followed  by  a carriage return or a space. Z8E will  display  the  current 
contents  of the register on the same line. At this point the user has  the 
option of entering an argument of any type if the contents of the  register 
or register pair are to be changed. The replacement value may be terminated 
by either a carriage return or a space. If no value is entered Z8E issues a 
carriage  return/line feed and waits for the next register mnemonic to  be 
entered.

If  the  user  specifies a 16 bit value as the new contents  of  an  8  bit 
register only the low order byte of the value is used.

The command terminates when a carriage return or space is entered when  Z8E 
is waiting for a register mnemonic.

S    Single Step
_________________________________________________________________

                              
The  S  command  allows  the  user to  execute  a  program  instruction  by 
instruction.  The S command provides for full tracing of the user  program. 
The format of the command is:

     *S   [/] [ARG1]  <cr>
               
          where  ARG1 is the number of instructions to execute in  the 
          user  program,  if no argument is given  Z8E defaults  to  1  
          ARG1 may be of any type

The slash "/" allows the user control over the tracing of subroutines. If a 
slash is included before the count (if a count is entered), or if the slash 
is  the  only character on the command line then subroutines  will  not  be 
traced.  A slash affects only CALL instructions which lie within the  range 
of  ARG1. In the most typical case no ARG1 is present and the  single  step 
count  defaults to 1. If the current PC, 1000 in this example, is  pointing 
to a call instruction then the command:

                    *S /

          1000  CD 56 30  RASRTN: CALL  ANYSUB
          1003  FE 04             CP    4
          1005  CA 17 10          JP    Z,AHEAD


will  cause  the entire subroutine ANYSUB to be executed and  control  will 
return to the user at address 1003. 

If  ARG1 is omitted Z8E will transfer control to the user program  and  one 
instruction,  the  one  pointed to by the current contents  of  the  user's 
program  counter,  will  be  executed.  Following  the  execution  of   the 
instruction  (or  group  of instructions if ARG2 was greater  than  1)  Z8E 
regains control and automatically displays the current contents of all  the 
user registers.

The  user may optionally indicate that more than one instruction is  to  be 
executed  by  entering a value greater than 1 for ARG1. Z8E  will  transfer 
control  to  the user program and regain control only  when  the  specified 
number  of  instructions  have been executed. This  feature  is  useful  in 
debugging small loops; in that the user can set ARG1 equal to the number of 
instructions  in  the  range of the loop. Z8E  will  display  the  register 
contents after each instruction of the loop is executed and return  control 
to the user after every iteration of the loop.

The  single  step command always causes the execution  of  the  instruction 
pointed  to by the current contents of the user's program counter. This  is 
the instruction that appears in disassembled form as part of the output  of 
the "X" command (display machine state). Bear in mind that ARG1 is not  the 
address  at which single stepping is to begin; it is a count to the  number 
of  instructions  to  execute. If the user desires to  single  step  at  an 
address  other than the one contained in the program counter, then  the  PC 
register must be modified via the R command before the single step  command 
is issued to Z8E.

Allowing  the convenience of entering "S" <cr> to execute  one  instruction 
has  the  side  effect of not allowing the user to  abort  the  command  in 
between  the  time  the  "S" is typed and the <cr>  is  entered  by  simply

omitting  an argument and typing <cr>. If you change your mind you can  use 
^X  to cancel the command or you can type in an invalid argument  as  ARG1. 
This  will cause a question mark to be displayed; however,  no  instruction 
will be executed. 

During block tracing (ARG1 greater than 1) the command may be terminated by 
hitting any key on the keyboard.

After  an  S  command  has  been issued pressing  the  <cr>  key  alone  is 
equivalent to issuing S <cr>.

The S command does not relocate instructions before execution as does the G 
command  (see G command). Hence, it is not possible to single step  through 
each iteration of a DJNZ $ instruction.

T    Select Debug Terminal
__________________________________________________________________

When Z8E is first invoked, the main terminal (i.e the console) is  enabled. 
Subsequently the T command may be used to enable an auxiliary terminal. 

The enabled terminal displays all Z8E output and is used by the operator to 
enter  commands  and  data  to Z8E. In this  way,  enabling  the  auxiliary 
terminal  allows  the user to debug a program which makes use of  the  main 
terminal  as  parts  of its function without fear that  the  debugger  will 
"walk" on his nice clean application screen. (Of course, the user must HAVE 
a second terminal to take advantage of this.)          

The format for the T command is as follows: 

      *T  ARG1 <cr>

          where ARG1 is the letter A to enable the auxiliary  terminal 
          or the letter C to re-enable the console terminal. 

          Any other letter will result in an error and will cause  two 
          question marks to be displayed (terminal selection does  not 
          change).

          Note that if the auxiliary terminal is enabled, and the user 
          types a CTRL-C on the auxiliary terminal, a warm boot  (sure 
          cure for cold feet) will be performed and the main  terminal 
          will  receive the CP/M prompt (no need to  transfer  control 
          back to the main terminal via "T M" first).         

                           * * *  CAUTION  * * *

    ------------------------------------------------------------------

The  user must have already configured 18E's auxiliary terminal  parameters 
and  must  have a terminal (set to the proper baud rate) connected  to  his 
auxiliary  port before executing a "T A" command. Failure to do  this  will 
result in a "locked up" computer which must be re-booted.

U    Write Symbol Table to Disk
_________________________________________________________________


The  U command allows the user to write the current symbol table to a  disk 
file. The format of the command is:

          
     *U   ARG1

               ARG1  is the name of the file to which the  symbol 
               table is to be written.

This command is useful to save any symbol names entered by the user via the 
A command. The entire symbol table is written to disk using the format of a 
next invokation of Z8E.

Note that since the file is stored as a .SYM formatted file the user should 
use  a file name extension that begin with the letter "S". This is  due  to 
the fact that the next time Z8E loads this symbol file it will examine  the 
the  first character of the file name extension. If the first character  is 
an  "S"  the  format is assumed to be .SYM and the symbol  table  is  built 
accordingly; the appearance of any other letter is taken to indicate a .PRN 
file. 

If a file with the name ARG1 already exists on disk it will be deleted.

V    Verify two memory blocks
_________________________________________________________________


The  V  command allows the user to compare two blocks of memory.  Z8E  will 
display all differences between the two. The format of the command is:

     *V   ARG1  ARG2  ARG3

          where  ARG1  =  the starting address of memory block 1

                 ARG2  =  the ending address of memory block 1

                 ARG3  =  the starting address of memory block 2

Z8E  compares memory block 1 to memory block 2 byte by byte. If a  mismatch 
occurs Z8E will display the address in each block at which the mismatch was 
found,  as  well  as the byte contained at  each  address.  The  comparison 
continues until the ending address is reached.

The  user  may halt the command at any time by depressing any  key  on  the 
keyboard.

W    Write Memory to a file
_________________________________________________________________


The  W  command allows the user to write the contents of memory to  a  disk 
file. The format of the command is:

          *W  arg1 [arg2  arg3]

               ARG1  is the name of a file to which writing  will 
               take place. 

               ARG2 and ARG3 are the optional starting and ending 
               addresses  of the portion of memory to be  written 
               to  the disk.   If the addresses omitted then  the 
               memory  block  to  be written is  defined  by  the 
               starting  and  ending addresses of the  last  file 
               loaded.   These  addresses can be  redisplayed  by 
               entering the I command with no arguments.


Z8E  always deletes any file on disk whose name is the same as ARG1. If  no 
file by this name exists then Z8E will automatically create it.

Z8E will echo the starting memory address and continually update the ending 
memory address as the writing to disk takes place.

Z8E  displays  displays  all registers, except the I  register  and  the  R 
register, on two lines of the console. In addition, the instruction pointed 
to  by  the  user's program counter is disassembled and  displayed  on  the 
second  line. Think of this as the "on deck" instruction:  the  instruction 
that  will  be executed upon the receipt of the next G (GO)  or  S  (SINGLE 
STEP) command.

Y    Fill Memory
_________________________________________________________________


The Y command fills a user specified block of memory with a user  specified 
pattern  of  bytes, the length of which is limited only by  the  length  of 
Z8E's input buffer which is 80 bytes long:

     *Y  ARG1  ARG2  ARG3  <cr>

         where  ARG1  =  the starting address of the block  to fill

                ARG2  =  the ending address of the block to  fill

                ARG3  =  is the data pattern to be written  to memory. 
                         ARG3  is evaluated by  Z8E as type  ARGUMENT-
                         STRING  which   may be of any length  in  the 
                         range   of  1  through the  number  of  bytes  
                         remaining in the input buffer once  ARG1  and 
                         ARG2 have been input.


The  Y  command gives the user the capability to initialize memory  to  any 
data  pattern.  The capability of entering multi-byte strings as  the  data 
pattern  with  which  to fill memory allows the  user  to  store  repeating 
patterns  of data in memory with a single command. For example if the  user 
entered the command:

          *Y 1000 127C 'abcd',16,77

Z8E  would begin writing the 6 byte pattern (61 62 63 64 16 77) entered  as 
ARG3  starting at address 1000. This pattern would repeat at address  1006, 
100C, 1012, etc. 

The  command ends after a byte is written to the ARG2 address even if  this 
byte  does  not  represent the last byte in the ARG3 block.  In  the  above 
example  the command would end when a byte is written to address 127C  even 
if that byte is not 77.

Z    Disassemble
_________________________________________________________________


The Z command allows the user to disassemble a block of data. Z8E  performs 
disassembly,  which  is the translation of binary memory data  into  source 
code  format, using the full Z80 instruction set and Zilog  mnemonics.  The 
resultant source code may be directed to the console or to the console  and 
a  disk  file  simultaneously.  Z8E also allows  the  user  to  disassemble 
interactively when ARG2 is equal to 1. The format of the command is:

     *Z  [ARG1 [ARG2 ARG3]]  <cr>

         where ARG1 is the address at which disassembly is to begin

               ARG2 is optional and represents the  upper limit of the 
                    disassembly  process (see details below)

               ARG3 is an optional file name specification for  disas-
                    sembly to disk

               ARG1 may be of any argument type. 

               ARG2 is  treated in one of two ways depending  on   its 
                    value: 

                 1) If  ARG2 evaluates to a number between 1 and   255 
                    (decimal)  Z8E will disassemble in  "block   mode" 
                    and  ARG2 becomes a count of the number   of  ins-
                    tructions  per block to disassemble.  As  will  be 
                    explained  below, Z8E pauses after  each block  is 
                    disassembled  and allows the  user to continue  or 
                    to terminate the command.

                    If  ARG2  is omitted altogether  a  default  block  
                    size  of  1  is used.   Whenever  ARG2  equals  1, 
                    either  explicitly  or   by  default,  Z8E  allows 
                    interactive  disassembly which allows the user  to 
                    choose the output format of the data.  Interactive 
                    disassembly is discussed below.

                 2) If ARG2 evaluates to a number greater than  255 it 
                    is assumed to be an ending address.  In this  case 
                    disassembly  will proceed from   starting  address 
                    (ARG1)  to  ending  address  (ARG2)  and  no  user 
                    intervention is required.

               ARG3 if  present, is assumed to be the name of a   disk 
                    file  into which the disassembled output will   be 
                    written. Z8E searches the specified disk for   the 
                    named file. If the file is found, then all  disas-
                    sembled output will be written to it,  overwriting 
                    any data that existed there. If the file  does not 
                    exist  the  file will be created using  the   name 
                    specified in ARG3. 

               NOTE: If ARG3 is present ARG2 must be explicitly  spec-
               ified,  otherwise Z8E will mistakenly treat  the   file 
               name as ARG2.

Z8E outputs to the console using the following format:


                                  - 50 -
        X  file the user should first load the file with the CP/M  LOAD  command 



     ADDRESS      OBJECT CODE      LABEL:   OPCODE    OPERAND


Z8E writes to disk using the following formart:
                                   
                                   LABEL:   OPCODE    OPERAND

Z8E  disassembles memory block by block in the user specified  block  size. 
After  each  block is output Z8E pauses for user input.  A carriage  return 
input  by  the  user  causes the next  block  to  be  disassembled  (unless 
interactive  mode is in effect), while any other character  terminates  the 
command.  Perhaps  the most convenient way to disassemble is to  specify  a 
count of one, either explicity or by omitting ARG2, and to use the carriage 
return  as an on/off switch.  Holding down the retun key  produces  output, 
releasing the return key ends output.

Z8E's disassembler is especially powerful when used in conjunction with the 
symbol facility. By building a symbol table with both .PRN and .SYM  files, 
and/or  creating user defined symbol names via the A command, the user  can 
virtually  recreate an assembler output listing (minus the  comments)  with 
Z8E inserting labels and symbolic operands wherever possible.

If  Z8E  cannot  match  an operand in the  disassembled  instruction  to  a 
corresponding symbol in the symbol table, or if no symbol table exists, Z8E 
uses the hexadecimal value.

If multiple symbols in the symbol table are equal to the same 16 bit  value 
or address, Z8E disassembles using the first symbol name encountered in the 
search of the symbol table which is equated to the 16 bit operand specified 
in  the  instruction being disassembled. This will unavoidably  produce  an 
occasional  misnamed operand when more than one symbol name is  equated  to 
the same 16 bit value. 

Z8E  does  not  substitute symbol names in  those  Z80  instructions  which 
reference 8 bit immediate data (ie. LD A,24H). Eight bit immediate data  is 
disassembled  as a quoted ASCII character if it's absolute value is in  the 
range 20 hex to 7E hex; otherwise, it is disassembled as a hex byte.

Output by Z8E to a disk file is instantly assemblable by most any assembler 
which  accepts Zilog mnemonics without any modifications other than  adding 
an END statement at the end of the file.

When  disassembling a block of memory (starting address to ending  address) 
the disassembly process may be halted at any time by depressing any key  on 
the keyboard.

Interactive disassembly allows the user to specify the format of the source 
code  produced  by disassembly on a line by line basis.  Interactive  mode, 
which is always in effect whenever ARG2 is equal to 1, causes Z8E to  pause 
after  each instruction is disassembled. This pause for input  permits  the 
user  to enter one of the following commands to choose the  desired  output 
format:

          converted  to  a quoted ASCII character. Values   less  than 
          hexadecimal 20 (ASCII space) or greater than  hexadecimal 7E 
          (ASCII tilde) cannot be disassembled  into this format. 

     HEX DEFB:

          The  8  bit contents of memory at  the  current  disassembly  
          address are converted to a hex byte.

     CODE:

          This is the normal default for disassembly. As Z8E  moves on 
          to  a  new address it will always display the   contents  of 
          memory  as  a  Z80 instruction. The "C" is  only  needed  to 
          redisplay  the contents of memory as an instruction had  one 
          of the other characters (A, B or D) already been entered. 

     HEX DEFW:

          The  contents  of the two bytes of memory  starting  at  the  
          loaction of the current disassembly address are output  as a 
          define word directive. The byte pointed to  directly by  the 
          current  disassembly address becomes the  low order byte  of 
          the  operand.  The  byte at disassembly   address  plus  one 
          becomes the high order byte.

     NOTE:
          If  Z8E had just disassembled a multi- byte Z80  instruction 
          and the user entered any of the characters listed above  (A, 
          B,  C, or D) only the first byte, or  first two for "D",  of 
          the  instruction   would  be  converted  to  the   requested  
          format.  The  remaining bytes of the  instruction  would  be 
          treated  as a new  Z80 instruction once the  user  proceeded  
          to the next disassembly address. 

     ADDING COMMENTS

          Z8E  allows  the  user  to  add  one  comment  per  line  of  
          disassembled code. If MAXLEN is set to 6 then comments   may 
          be  up to 29 characters in length. If MAXLEN is set   to  14 
          then comments may be up to 16 characters in  length.

                APPENDIX A - FILE FORMAT FOR SYMBOL TABLES

Z8E  is  currently set up to be able to read any of  the  listing 
files  which appear below:

    1. Microsoft   MACRO-80    V3.37  .PRN files  May 8, 1980
    2. Microsoft   MACRO-80    V3.44  .PRN files  Dec 9, 1981
    3. Microsoft   LINK-80     V3.44  .SYM files  Dec 9, 1981 
    4. SLR Systems Z80ASM      V1.07  .LST files
    5. SLR Systems SLRNK       V1.07  .SYM files       
    6. SLR Systems Z80ASM      V1.3   .PRN files

The unique characteristics of each are:

    MACRO-80 V3.37

          Z8E searches for the 8 byte string "Symbols:" in the   file. 
          Once  this string is found, Z8E expects an  ASCII   carriage 
          return character and an ASCII line feed character to be  the 
          next two bytes in the file. The symbol  table listing should 
          begin in the next character position  in the file.

          Each line of the symbol table listing contains four   symbol 
          names and an associated address. 

          If  the  character following the symbol's hex  value  is  an  
          apostophe, the symbol is considered to be program  relative. 
          If  the user specified a bias in the command line  the  bias 
          will be added to the symbol's value.

          If the character following the symbol's hex value is an  "I" 
          (meaning  that  the symbol is globally  defined)  then   the 
          character following the "I" is examined. If this   character 
          is  an apostrophe it is considered to be  program   relative 
          and the bias, if specified is added to the  value.

          If the character following the hex symbol value or the   "I" 
          is  any  character  besides an  apostrophe,  the  symbol  is  
          considered absolute and the bias will not be added.

          The  file  should be terminated with  the  CP/M  end-of-file  
          character (control Z which is equivalent to a hex 1A).

          If  the  string  "Symbols" is never found,  Z8E  prints  the  
          message: Symbol Table not Found

    MACRO-80  V3.44

          Z8E searches for the 8 byte string "Symbols:" in the   file. 
          Once  this string is found, Z8E expects an  ASCII   carriage 
          return character and an ASCII line feed character to be  the 
          next two bytes in the file. The symbol  table listing should 
          begin in the next character position  in the file.

          In this release of MACRO-80 the format of the symbol   table 
          is  completely  opposite of V3.37. That is, the  hex   value 
          appears  before  the symbol name. In  addition,  these   hex 
          value/symbol name combination appear three per line.

          The  character appearing after the hex value is  interpreted 
          as described for version 3.37. 

          If  the  string  "Symbols" is never found,  Z8E  prints  the  
          message: Symbol Table not Found

    
    LINK-80  V3.44

          LINK-80 can optionally produce a link map (.SYM file)  which 
          lists  all globally defined symbols if the  user   specifies 
          the  "Y"  option  the L80 command  line.   Z8E   treats  all 
          symbols  names loaded from a LINK-80 .SYM file  as  absolute 
          (non-relocatable)  addresses.  Nevertheless,   if  the  user 
          specifies  a bias, it will be added to every   symbol  value 
          read in from the .SYM file.

          Z8E expects the first symbol value in a .SYM file to   begin 
          in  the first byte position in the file. Each  symbol  value 
          consists  of four hexadecimal bytes in ASCII  followed by  a 
          tab  character. Immediately after the tab  character is  the 
          symbol  name which may be between one and  six  alphanumeric 
          characters in length. The symbol name  is followed by a  tab 
          and the sequence repeats. Every  fourth symbol  value/symbol 
          name pair should be followed  by a carriage return and  line 
          feed.

          The  file  should be terminated with  the  CP/M  end-of-file  
          character (control Z which is equivalent to a hex 1A).


    Z80ASM

          Z80ASM may be configured to produce either 80 or 132  column 
          output.

          Z8E  searches for the 8 byte string "Symbol Table:"  in  the  
          file. This string need not be at the beginning of the  file; 
          Z8E  will  scan the entire file looking for it.  Once   this 
          string  is  found,  Z8E expects an  ASCII  carriage   return 
          character  and an ASCII line feed character to be  the  next 
          two bytes in the file. The symbol table listing should begin 
          in the next character position in the  file.

          In  a  Z80ASM  .LST file the hex value  appears  before  the  
          symbol  name.  Hex  value/symbol  name  combinations  appear  
          three  per  line. Z80ASM symbol names may contain up  to  16  
          characters.  Z8E  will accept the first 14 characters  of  a

        X  file the user should first load the file with the CP/M  LOAD  command 


          symbol name if MAXLEN is set to 14 or the first 6 characters 
          if MAXLEN is set to 6. 

          If  the  string "Symbol Table:" is never found,  Z8E  prints  
          the message: 

                     Symbol Table Not Found

    SLRNK

          SLRNK can optionally produce a link map (.SYM File)  similar 
          to  the  one produced by Link-80. Z8E  treats  all   symbols 
          loaded from a SLRNK .SYM file as absolute symbols.  However, 
          as  in  the  case of Link-80 .SYM files,  Z8E   will  add  a 
          relocation bias to each symbol if one is  specified.

          Each  symbol  value in a SLRNK .SYM file  consists  of  four  
          hexadecimal  bytes  followed  by a  space  followed  by  the  
          symbol  name. The symbol name is followed by two ASCII   tab 
          characters. 

          Use SLRNK's /M option to produce a link map.

NOTE:

     While  reading in a MACRO-80 .PRN file, or a Z80ASM  .LST   file, 
     Z8E is capable of reading an entire assembly listing file looking 
     for  the  "Symbols:"  string or "Symbol   Table:"  string.  These 
     strings  need  not  be located at the   beginning  of  the  file. 
     However,  the  loading of the  symbol table will  be  speeded  up 
     considerably  if the  symbol table is the only data in the  file. 
     This  is  accomplished quite easily in both MACRO-80  by  turning 
     off   the  listing  during an assembly through  the  use  of  the  
     .XLIST  directive. The listing can then be turned back  on   just 
     prior to the END directive via a .LIST directive to  ensure  that 
     the symbol table is written to disk.

     If you are using Z80ASM use the /S option to instruct  Z80ASM  to 
     produce a symbol file.

     Z8E is able to process symbol tables which occupy multiple  pages 
     in any of the file types mentioned above. Headings which  precede 
     each page are automatically ignored by Z8E.

                 APPENDIX C - Hitachi HD64180 Instructions

In  addition  to  the 67 Z80 mnemonics and the 5  pseudo-ops  supported  by 
vanilla Z8E, the Z180 version also supports the 10 Hitachi HD64180-specific 
mnemonics. 

The  Z80  mnemonics are all either 2, 3 or 4 characters long  while  the  5 
pseudo-ops are either 3 or 4 characters long. The Hitachi  HD64180-specific 
mnemonics do not quite fit this mold in that three of them (only the Japan-
ese know why) are 5 characters long.

After  careful  deliberation,  it  was decided  to  implement  these  three 
"rogues" as 4 character mnemonics for 18E. The following table shows all 10 
Hitachi HD64180-specific mnemonics and their 18E equivalents.

                  g     register A, B, C, D, E, H or L
                 ww     register pair BC, DE, HL or SP
                (m)     8 bit I/O port address
                  m     8 bit immediate data

Three  tiny macros can account for the truncated  mnemonics if you  want to 
assemble Z180 source files generated from a Z8E disassembly.

Size of resident Z8E debug code:

The  resident  size of Z8E depends on the configuration.  The  sizes  shown 
here  were  obtained  for an ANSI console.  Where  a  second  terminal  was 
configured then it was either a second ANSI screen or an ADM3A.

     Z80 instructions, single screen         9.25 kBytes
     Z80 instructions, dual screens          9.25 kBytes
     HD64180/Z180, single screen             9.5  kBytes
     HD64180/Z180, dual screens              9.5  kBytes

For comparison, ZSID occupies 8.5 kBytes and SID occupies 6.75 kBytes.  For 
the extra .75 kByte over ZSID you get the full screen animated display, the 
use of a second display to separate debug output from program output, and a 
pretty good disassembler which can create a usable source file.  And for an 
extra .25 kBytes you can do all of the above on a Z180/HD64180.

None of the numbers quoted above includes any space occupied by symbols  so 
the comparison is fair.
