;
; 18 Feb 18 hp  v4.2	Fixed the "Sybol Table Not Found" error that happened
;			when loading a .SYM symbol file that ended exactly at
;			a record boundary.
;
;			Clear Screen is now done by sending the appropriate
;			control sequences to the terminal, and no longer by
;			outputting a bunch of line-feeds.
;			
; 12 Feb 15 jrs v4.1	Minor optimisation to enable sharing of terminal I/O
;			code when using an auxiliary terminal with the same
;			characteriscs as the console.  (This is usually the
;			situation when running Z8E on a CP/M emulator.)
;
;			Cleaned up some labels, removing many "if ASMB" tests
;			which cluttered the source code.
;
;			Rationalised terminal selection. Now it is all done
;			by including small external files during assembly.
;			Some sample files are provided and these can be used
;			as a basis for developing new ones.
;
;			Changed action of CR on repeatable commands.  Now the
;			general rule is that when it makes sense, CR repeats
;			(continues) the current command whereas anything else 
;			interrupts it.  The affected commands were:
;				D - Dump
;				H - Show symbol table
;				Z - Disassemble
;
;			Modified source where necessary to make it assemble
;			with the Cromemco CDOS macro assembler.  Changed the
;			assembly-time switch from ASMB to ZASMB to reflect the
;			name by which the assembler is more recently known.
;
; 28 Aug 12 hp  v4.0	Added HD64180 support from Damon R. Gibson's 18E v1.0
;			together with the auxiliary terminal support.  Set the
;			Z180 equate to TRUE to generate a 64180 debugger or
;			leave it false to generate a standard Z80 debugger.
;
;			These patches are from 19 Dec 00 and were forward-
;			ported by jrs.
;
; 10 May 12 jrs v3.6.2	Fixed a bug which prevented the loading of symbols
;			from .PRN files generated by the SLR assembler.
;
; 18 Aug 11 jrs v3.6.1	Fixed a minor bug in screen addressing which I had
;			introduced in 3.6.
;
;  3 Aug 11 jrs v3.6	Made screen height patchable.  This is only useful
;			for CP/M 2.2 because new code which detects CP/M 3
;			pulls the screen height from the SCB (System Control
;			Block).  Either way Z8E is no longer limited to a
;			24-line screen.
;
; 27 Dec 88 jrs v3.5	Released 24 Jan 89.  Includes a few patches by
;			George Havach.
;
;		1.	Changed operation of <cr> in some commands to make
;			a more consistent user interface.  (I won't be
;			offended if users want it changed back - jrs.)
;
;		2.	Enhancement to patch 1.5:- altered the search for
;			"MACRO-80" sentinel in .PRN files to allow for a
;			TITLE pseudo-op.
;
;		3.	Shortened and improved the code for the 'I' command.
;
;		4.	Tested and corrected the ANSIXYCP module which I have
;			been supplying since May 1987.  The code has now been
;			incorporated into the main source file and can be
;			activated during assembly by setting "aterm equ true".
;
;		5.	Discarded the '#' command introduced in 3.3.11 as with
;			a minor adjustment the 'L' command with no file name
;			does the same thing.
;
;		6.	If S or J was last command issued then <cr> alone
;			repeats S or J in single-step mode.  Very useful for
;			stepping through a small section of a program.
;
;	(gah)	7.	Adapted a patch by George Havach to correct the display
;			of IX and IY in disassembled instructions when upper
;			case is set.
;
;	(gah)	8.	Made room for patching in 'clear screen' code at
;			MBANNR: for more dignified start-up.
;
;	(gah)	9.	Replaced tilde ("~") with period (".") as a general
;			substitute for non-displayable ASCII characters, for
;			consistency with practically every other screen-dump
;			utility.  [Retained "hazeltine" conditional - jrs]
;
; 12 Dec 88 jrs v3.4	Made patch 3.3.1 object-configurable because some
;			terminals, particularly those which have binary
;			cursor addressing, must use an offset of 80h to stop
;			the BDOS from expanding tabs and for those terminals
;			clearing bit 7 is nasty.
;
; 5 Dec 88 eg  v3.3	Included a number of fixes and features submitted by
; (installed by jrs)	Eric Gans in January and March 88.
;
;		 1.	Clear bit 7 of characters sent to screen to avoid
;			strange effects on some computers (such as Kaypro
;			which prints graphic characters if bit 7 is on).
;
;		 2.	Allow 'z' command without an address to mean dis-
;			assemble from last instruction for last-specified
;			number of lines.
;
;		 3.	Allow 'g' command without an address to mean the
;			equivalent of 'g  pc'  or  'g  $' (i.e. continue
;			execution from current instruction).
;
;		 4.	Show absolute destination addresses when dis-
;			assembling relative jump instructions (jr and djnz).
;
;		 5.	Display flags along with registers when using the
;			's' and 'x' commands.
;
;		 6.	Allow easy refresh of the 'animated debug' screen
;			after program output has disturbed it.  Use 'j  #'
;			to force refresh.
;
;		 7.	After Z8E's internal disk I/O operations, reset
;			DMA to 80h for the benefit of target programs.
;
;		 8.	Allow cancellation of commands with CAN (ctrl-X)
;			when argument buffer is empty.  For example if you
;			have entered 'd  100' then first ^X erases the '100'
;			and the second cancels the 'd'.
;
;		 9.	Implement '>' command to change user number and so
;			allow loading of files from user areas other than
;			that from which Z8E was initiated.
;
;		10.	Implement '?' command to evaluate and display argument
;			expressions.  Accepts a register name as the first
;			operand.  (reg) allows indirect addressing so that,
;			for example, '?  (hl)' displays value at the memory
;			location whose address is contained in HL.
;
;		11.	Implement '#' command to recall and display the
;			highest address occupied by a program.
;			
;  4 Dec 88 jrs v3.2	Expand asterisks in file names when using 'i' command.
;
; 27 Nov 88 jrs v3.1	Bug fix - deleted three spurious instructions from
;			the initialisation code which was added to support
;			breakpoint vectors at addresses other than 38h.
;
; 16 Nov 88 jrs v3.0	Bumped version number to regain sequence with USA.
;			Until now there were two independent streams of
;			development.  (A date prefixed by '-' denotes a
;			version from the "USA" stream).
;
;			Extended Jim Moore's idea of substituting RST 30h
;			(RST 6) for RST 38h (RST 7).  Now the breakpoint
;			vector address can be patched without re-assembling.
;
; 11 Nov 88 jrs v1.5	Added code to distinguish between .PRN files created
;			by Macro-80 and Z80ASM 1.3 so Z8E can load symbols
;			from either type of .PRN file.
;
;-30 Nov 87 eg  v2.1	FCB and command tail initialisation routine supplied
;			by Eric Gans.  [Does not appear in the current source
;			as it duplicated v1.4 but consumed more code space.]
;
; 15 May 87 jrs v1.4	Implemented "I" command to initialise the command
;			tail at 80h and the default FCB name blocks at 5Ch
;			and 6Ch.
;
;			Renamed I(nput) command to L(oad) to make way for new
;			I(nitialise) command.  Documentation changed 13/6/87.
;
;			Filtered source code to all lower case.  Sometime
;			Between 1.0 And 1.2 The Comments Had Been Modified So
;			That Every Word Started With A Capital Letter And It
;			Really Did Look Quite Silly.
;
; 20 Apr 87 jrs v1.3	Fixed register display in animated debug mode.  Z8E
;			now handles EX AF,AF' and EXX instructions correctly.
;			Duplicates patch of 21 Oct 86 but was developed quite
;			independently and coded very differently.
;
;			Added equates to tailor the source to assemblers
;			other than M80.
;
;-21 Oct 86 fh  v2.0	Fixed register display in animated debug mode.  Z8E
; (installed by gbi)	now handles EX AF,AF' and EXX instructions correctly.
;
;  8 Mar 86 jrs v1.2	(No version number change - all mods purely cosmetic)
;			Modified org directives to bypass bug in M80.
;			Added jterm conditional for testing.
;			Added hazeltine conditional for tilde suppression.
;			Changed dates to more universal format.
;
; 16 Jan 86 ijb v1.2	Cursor addressing for post '=>' in jdbg75
;			to cover systems that have a destructive bs
;
;- 3 Dec 85 jgm v?.?	Added EQUates for breakpoint address so it could be
;			something other than 38h.
;

;			Fix usym bug

;*
;*	Initialization:
;*	- Save system I	register
;*	- Determine max symbol length before loading symbol table
;*        permissible values are 6 and 14 which are converted to bit
;*	  masks by bumping by one 
;*	- Set CP/M DMA address to 80h
;*	- Check first command line argument for (xx) where xx is the
;*	  number of slots in the symbol table to reserve.
;*	- Move first file name found in command line to local memory
;*	  since it will be loaded last.  At the end of initialization
;*	  (or symbol loading if required) this file name will be loaded
;*	  into the keyboard input buffer and the file will be loaded
;*	  just as if the user had entered the info as a Z8E command.
;*	- Move all subsequent file names in the	command	line buffer to
;*	  local input buffer (inbf) in low memory, where they can
;*	  be found by the parse	routine (prsr).
;*
;*	Relocating loader:
;*	- Move absolute	memory image of	Z8E to top of TPA
;*	- Adjust all addresses in relocated monitor to reflect new
;*	  execution area.  This is accomplished by repeated calls to
;*	  zlen to calculate instruction	lengths.
;*	- All addresses	< the absolute value of	z8eorg are considered
;*	  to be	absolute values	and are	not modified.
;*	- Relocate all address pointers	in command and operand jump

;*	jdbg:	animated debugger
;*		
;*	Jdbg allows the user to watch the Z80 CPU actually execute the
;*	code.  Jdbg displays 18 disassembled instructions on the screen
;*	as well as a user defined memory block referred to in the 
;*	comments as a window.
;*
;*	Entry point jdbg:
;*	
;*	Jdbg processes user input as a prelude to the actual animation
;*	of the code.  The user enters the starting address to animate
;*	optionally preceded by a subroutine qualifier.  The subroutine
;*	qualifier may be either a "*" which instructs Z8E not to trace
;*	any subroutines which are located below 100h (ie. bdos calls),
;*	or it may be a "/" which means no tracing of any subroutines.
;*	Jdbg will also paint the original screen with the register
;*	contents as well as the memory window.  The contents of the 
;*	memory window are also moved into argbuf so that we can compare
;*	the 'old' contents with the 'new' contents once a the first bp
;*	is reached.
;*
;*	Entry point jdbg30:
;*
;* 	Entered here via bphn who determines that animation is in
;*	effect.  In order to cut down on superfluous cursor move-
;*	ment on the screen we compare the old register and memory
;*	window contents with the new contents following the latest
;*	bp.  We only output the changes.  Next we determine if the 
;*	current pc exists in disassembled form somewhere on the 
;*	screen; if not, we display 18 new disassembled instructions 
;*	with the current pc as line one.
;*
;*	Exit jdbg95:
;*
;*	Save current register contents and jump to step40 for next
;*	single step.

;******************************************************************************
;*
;*	prsr:	command	line parse routine
;*
;*	prsr will extract one argument from the	input buffer (inbf) and
;*	write it into the parse	buffer (prsbf).	an argument is treated
;*	as starting with the first non-delimeter character encountered
;*	in the input buffer and ends with the next delimeter found.
;*	all intervening	characters between the two delimeters are
;*	treated	as the argument	and are	moved to prsbf.
;*
;*	as each character is extracted from inbf a zero is written back
;*	to replace it.  thus a program which needs to extract multiple args
;*	need not save pointers in between calls	since prsr is trained
;*	to strip leading delimeters while looking for the start	of an
;*	argument:
;*
;*	     delimeters: null, space, comma
;*
;*	exit:	    de - starting address of parse buffer
;*		     b - sign bit: set if unbalanced parens, else sign reset
;*			 bits 6-0: number of chars in the parse	buffer
;*		     a - actual	delimter char which caused to terminate
;*		     f - zero flag set if no error
;*		quoflg - set equal to ascii quote if at	least one quote found

;*	the disassembler is divided into two routines:
;*
;*	zasm -	computes the instruction key value and finds the opcode
;*		mnemonic
;*
;*	opn  -	uses the key value to determine the number of operands and
;*		displays the operands.
;*
;*	On entry, DE holds the starting address for disassembly.
;*
;*	zasm maps the 695 z80 instructions into 256 key values.  The
;*	instruction key value becomes the index into the opcode name
;*	pointer table (zopcnm), the first operand table (zopnd1), and
;*	the second operand table (zopnd2).
;*
;*	Disassembly is done in user specified block sizes if the dis-
;*	assembly count evaluates to a number between 1 and 255.  if the
;*	count is greater than 255 the block is disassembled and the
;*	command terminates.
;*
;*
;*	zasm15 - start of the disassembly loop
;*	zasmpc - address of the	instruction being disassembled
;*	zasmfb - disassembly flag byte
;*	zmflag - flag indicating directive processing (defb and	defw)
;*

;*			table of op code names
;*
;*	Supports 67 Z80 Mnemonics, 5 Pseudo-ops and 10 HD64180 Mnemonics
;*
;*	Three of Hitachi's HD64180 Mnemonics are 5 characters long
;*	(only the Japanese know why) but it was decided to implement
;*	them as 4 characters for 18E as follows:
;*
;*			 HITACHI |   18E
;*			---------+--------
;*			 TSTIO   |   TSIO
;*			 OTIMR   |   OIMR
;*			 OTDMR   |   ODMR
;*
;*	The management sincerely hopes that this little exercise in
;*	poetic license will not inconvenience anyone in the least!!
