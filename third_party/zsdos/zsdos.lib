;   P2DOS introduced a search path feature compatible with that used in
; Richard Conn's ZCPR2 and ZCPR3.  If a requested file is not located in
; the currently logged Drive/User, the SEARCH routine will sequentially
; scan along the path until either the file is found or the end of the
; path is reached.

; byte sensing.

;----------
;   Some systems, like the Kaypro 4, only recognize changes between single
; and double-sided disks when the system is warm booted; BDOS Function 13
; (reset disk) will not work.  By adding a "hook" to the BIOS of these mach-
; ines and setting RESDSK to TRUE, BDOS functions 13 and 37 will allow changes
; between single and double-sided disks; very handy for disk housekeeping
; utilities such as NSWP, NULU, and cataloging programs.

;   The "hook" is added as follows: Obtain the source to your computer's BIOS.
; Examine the code for WARM BOOT.  Somewhere, there should be a call to a rou-
; tine which initializes the disk system after a warm boot, or which detects
; changes between single and double-sided disks.  Call this routine DISKINT
; for purposes of discussion.  Modify your BIOS's cold boot routine to ini-
; tialize 3 bytes at address SETDSK as "JP DISKINT".  The location of SETDSK
; is arbitrary, it may be in your BIOS, or in a reserved spot in CP/M's page 0.

;   The following equate is used to produce separate code and data segments
; for blowing ZSDOS into ROM.  Calling BDOS Function 0 will initialize the
; Data Segment to default values.

ROM     EQU     FALSE           ; Separate data and code?

;----------
;   Many ZSDOS features can be controlled while ZSDOS is running by altering
; the FLAG byte.  Set the following equate to your desired configuration based
; on your requirements.  The individual bit assignments in the FLAG byte are:
;
; Bit - 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
;        \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \__Public File Enable (1) / Disable (0)

;              \ \________Path without System Enable (1) / Disable (0)
;               \_________(Reserved)

; The operation of Bit 6 represents a deviation from the description of PUBLIC
; Files as given in DDJ Article by Bridger Mitchell and Derek McKay of Plu*
; Perfect Systems.  The PUBLIC Specification states that Public Files will NOT
; be found by any wildcard reference except when a "?" is in the FCB+0 byte.
; The code here relaxes that requirement as follows:  If we are in the same
; user area as the public file, then don't report the file as PUBLIC, but find
; it.  This has a nasty side effect - it allows erasing of PUBLIC files if we
; are in the same area.  However, these files also show up on the directory
; (they wouldn't otherwise), so at least we should know we're blasting them.

;----------
; Equates for selecting ZSDOS or ZDDOS configurations

; Since much ZSDOS code must be deleted to embed DateStamper in ZDDOS, the
; following flags do the stripping:
;       PICKEY  - True = Don't save users' DE register
;       CTLREN  - True = Add ^R Retype line to cons read, False = No ^R
;       UNROLL  - True = Inline code for shifts, False = collapse into loops
;       UPATH   - True = Add User path from OS, False = No OS path search

; To Use the Named-COMMON aspect of NZCOM and JETLOADER (tm), the BIOS must
; be referenced from the _BIOS_ name.  If operating under this scheme, set
; the ZRL equate to TRUE.  With the ZRL equate set to FALSE, a standalone
; .REL file will be produced with no external requirements.

ZRL     EQU     FALSE           ; Set True .ZRL file with COMMON for NZCOM,
