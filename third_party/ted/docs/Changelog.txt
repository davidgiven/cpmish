Changelog
---------

(Old Changelog going back to 2011 was lost)

03/02/16

- System-dependent routines now in a separate file. The RSX180 version can
  already read files.


05/02/16

- Got the virtual memory working under RSX180 (TED writes data to work file
  leaving gaps or "holes" that may get filled later; since RSX180 does not
  support "holes" yet, a workaround had to be implemented in the code.)

  A bug appeared:
    'run $ted/inc=10000' and read a large file, e.g.: 'r [test]snake.lst',
    then 'pr 1 $' shows only 905 lines instead of 1833.


06/02/16

- Fixed the bug above. It was in the main code and affected the CP/M version
  as well (NEWBUF routine modified register B, so the 'dirty' flag set by
  LDRECD was lost and the corresponding modified buffer was not saved back
  to disk).

- TED now processes the RSX180 command line. File read and write practically
  finished, so the editor is now usable.


21/02/16

- Use existing filename from R command for W command without arguments (this
  affected the CP/M version as well).


23/11/16

- RSX180 file I/O routines converted to filesystem v4.


11/01/18

- Implementing soft-tab handling:
  * STORE and EXPAND routines modified, tabs are now stored in the virtual
    memory records.
  * DISPLE routine modified, so display appears correctly.
  * FPUTC1 routine modified, so file output does not contain soft-spaces.
  * ruler now displays 2-digit numbers if > 10 (does not wrap back to 0).
  * INSert mode now shown on status line.


12/01/18

- CR now splits line at cursor column.

- Removed the rather useless commands ^A ^B ^O ^P of the screen mode.

- Refresh screen keeps original cursor position.

- Default mode is now insert (tired of toggling it every time).

- Insert character routine now checks for smart tabs.


13/01/18

- Insert/replace (soft) tab now works.

- Delete char right working.


14/01/18

- Automatically scroll screen left/right when moving cursor beyond right/left
  edge.

- Split/join now handle tabs correctly.

- Delete char left working.

- CURX now represents character index in screen mode and not screen cursor
  position, this optimizes somewhat character access (no need to add SCRX
  every time.)

- SETCUR now scrolls screen left/right so cursor always stays in window.

- JOIN now truncates resulting line if too long.

- Better line overflow checks, but not perfect yet.


17/01/18

- Source converted to Z80 mnemonics, the old 8080 version will be kept but
  no longer updated.


21/01/18

- Revised/fixed SHRLN and SRLLN routines.

- Optimized SHRLN8 and SHRLN8 routines of the smart-tab support.

- Optimized tab insertion/deletion.

- Soft-tab handling almost complete.

- P command now accepts a second argument (cursor column).

- RSX180 version now uses SYSLIB routines (not fully done yet).


22/01/18

- Fixed end of line case when inserting chars.

- Status line now always shows the cursor line (after a small delay).


24/01/18

- Track file modifications and issue a warning if the user tries to exit or
  clear the buffer without saving.


17/03/18

- RSX180 version now uses the new IO.RVB/WVB for work file I/O.


20/03/18

- Entering ^Z at the command prompt now exits the program, ^G replaces the
  old ^Z function (reenter last command).


24/03/18

- RSX180 version now uses IO.RVB/WVB for regular file I/O.


23/05/18

- Use scroll region if supported by the terminal (VT100, etc.).


04/11/18

- Fixed a stupid bug in the delete-line function of the screen mode (LASTLN
  is a 16-bit value, but was used as 8-bit value in a comparison operation!).
