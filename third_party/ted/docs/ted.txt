                            TED - Text Editor

1. Introduction
 
TED is a screen-oriented text editor that can be used to create new files
and edit existing ones. It is a clone of an editor of the same name that
ran under RT-11, although not an identical one. In particular, this
version implements smart tab handling the way the old Borland editors
did, and has a different set of screen editing commands which is more
WordStar-like.

The editor does not operate directly on the original text file. Instead, it
loads the text file entirely into its virtual memory buffer, where the
modifications are actually made. When TED is first started, the buffer is
empty. A Read command loads the contents of the file to be edited into the
internal buffer, making it available for edit. Another command, Write, saves
the buffer back into a file.

The three main operations (read, edit and write) are independent of each
other and can be executed in any arbitrary order. To create a new file,
just enter the screen editor and start typing. After saving the text into
a file, we can edit it again and save a different version under a different
file name. With a buffer CLear command we can start again from the beginning.

The editor has two main modes of operation: command and screen. Command mode
is used mainly for those operations that require one or more parameters to be
specified (e.g. deleting or moving a number of lines, reading a file
fully of partially, etc.) In screen mode, the user can modify the text
directly by positioning the cursor using the arrow keys and typing or
deleting characters and lines.

The maximum line length allowed by the editor is 162 characters. The maximum
file size is limited to about 1 Mbyte, and does not depend on the amount of
RAM available.


2. Command mode

In the command description below we use the following terms and conventions:

 * Square brackets enclose optional parameters.

 * FILE represents a standard file specification by the operating system
   standards.

 * N, N1, N2 are decimal numeric values, often representing line numbers.
   The special dollar-sign character "$" can be used to address the last
   line in the text buffer or file, depending of the context.

 * P, P1, P2 are text indexes, and represent a specific position in the
   text buffer. Text indexes specify both line number and character position
   within the line. The first character in a line has always an index value
   of zero. The index specification can be:

   - A decimal line number, the character $ (representing the number of
     the last line of text) and/or an expression using the arithmetic + and
     and - operators. If the resulting value of the expression is greater
     than the number of lines currently in the buffer, then the number of
     the last line is used. This type of text index specification always
     sets the character position to the start of the line.

   - A search string consisting of at least one character. The editor will
     try to find the string in the text buffer and, if found, the index will
     be set to the first character of the matched string in the text. The
     search string must be delimited with one of the following characters:

        !  "  %  &  '  =  :  \  /  ?  <  >

     The search string in the description that follow will be represented as:

     /STRING/

     where in place of "/" any of the characters listed above can be used,
     and STRING is any non-empty sequence of characters that does not
     contain the delimiter. When such an index is specified, the search
     begins from the current cursor position until the end of the text is
     reached. If desired, a different start line number can be specified
     like this:

     /STRING/(N)

     in this case, search starts from the N-th line (see above for the N 
     specification). Search limits can also be specified as:

     /STRING/(N1,N2)

     The following forms are also allowed:

     /STRING/(,N2)
     /STRING/(N1,N2)+N


2.1 Command descriptions

TED commands are one or two character long, optionally followed by one or
more arguments separated by spaces, tabs or a comma.

Commands are ended with either Return or Ctrl-C. When Ctrl-C is used, the
screen editor is entered after command execution.

An empty command is also allowed (e.g. by pressing Return or Ctrl-C at the
prompt). That simply causes the editor to enter the screen mode.

The commands are described below:

Ctrl-Z or EX

   Exit the editor and return to the operating system. The current buffer
   contents are not saved, so any changes made will be lost.

CL

   Clear the text buffer. Any modifications or new text added will be lost
   unless saved to a file first.

R [(P)] FILE (N1,N2)

   Read the file FILE into the text buffer:

   * If N1 and N2 are specified, only the fragment from line N1 to N2 is
     read, otherwise the whole file is loaded.
     
   * If P is specified, then the file is inserted following the line P in
     the current buffer, otherwise the file is appended to the end.

   * The FILE parameter cannot be omitted.

   * All trailing spaces in the line are removed.

W [P1 P2] [FILE] [N]

   Write the contents of the text buffer from line P1 to P2 into file FILE
   after line N:

   * If P1 and P2 are omitted, the whole contents of the text buffer is
     written to the file. If only one parameter is specified, then only the
     specified line is written.

   * If FILE is omitted, the file name from the latest R command will be
     used.

   * N can be either zero of the dollar sign "$". In the first case the
     output file is truncated, erasing any old file contents. In the second
     case, the file will be opened in append mode and the contents of the
     text buffer will be added following the last text line of the file.
     If the parameter is not specified, zero is assumed.

F

   Display the name of the file read by the last R command. This is the
   name that will be used by the W command if the FILE parameter is omitted.

PR P1 [P2]

   Output (PRint) text lines from P1 to P2 to the terminal. If P2 is omitted,
   only one line will be displayed. P2 can also be the dollar sign, which
   represents the last line of the text. Any control characters are output
   as ^X.

D P1 [P2]

   Delete lines from P1 to P2 inclusive. If P2 is not specified, then only
   a single line is deleted.

M P1 P2 P3

   Copy lines from P1 to P2 after line P3. If P2 equals P1, only a single
   line is copied.

MD P1 P2 P3 

   Move lines from P1 to P2 after line P3. The original lines in the range
   P1 to P2 are then deleted. If P2 equals P1 then only a single line is
   moved.

SU   /OLD/NEW/[(N1[,N2])]
SU M /OLD/NEW/[(N1[,N2])]
SU N /OLD/NEW/[(N1[,N2])]

   Search and replace text (SUbstitute). OLD is the string to search for,
   while NEW is the text that will replace OLD. NEW can be an empty string,
   but OLD cannot. Valid delimiter characters are listed in the section 2
   above.

   The substitute command can work in one of the following modes:
   
   * The substitution is made everywhere in the text where OLD is found.
     This is the default behavior.

   * When M is specified as the first parameter, lines containing OLD are
     displayed on the terminal with the OLD portion enclosed in double-quotes,
     followed by a "Y-<CR>-^C" prompt:

      - to replace text and continue, press Y.

      - to skip the current matched string and continue, press Enter.

      - to abort the current and all following substitutions, press Ctrl-C.

   * If the number of substitutions to do is known beforehand, then the
     value N can be specified in place of the first parameter. In this case
     the editor will not ask for confirmation.

   In every case the editor displays on the terminal the line after the
   substitutions are made.

   If necessary, a range of lines where substitutions should be made can be
   specified right after NEW, enclosed in parenthesis.

S [P]

   Enter screen mode. The top line of the screen will be set to parameter
   P, if specified, or to the current text marker.

P [P]

   Set text marker to line P. If P is not specified, the current cursor
   position is displayed.

FR

   Displays the amount of available memory.


2.2 Command line edition

The command mode allows simple editing of command lines. The editor always
remembers the last command entered, which can be later recalled fully or
partially.

Ctrl-U or Ctrl-^

     Delete the current line.

DEL, Backspace or Ctrl-H

     Delete one character left.

Left Arrow (Ctrl-S)

     Delete one character left.

Right Arrow (Ctrl-D)

     Restore one character from the previous command at the current cursor
     position.

Up Arrow (Ctrl-E)

     Restore (recall) all remaining characters from the previous command
     starting from the current cursor position.

Ctrl-G

     Same as above, but the command is entered and executed immediately.
     Used mostly to repeat the last command entered by typing Ctrl-G at
     the editor prompt.


3. Screen mode.

This is the main mode of text edition. The cursor can be moved around the
screen, text entered and/or deleted, etc.

Printable characters are entered at the current cursor position, moving the
cursor one column to the right afterwards. Other operations are performed
via Ctrl-key combinations or dedicated terminal keys:

Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Z

     Exit screen mode back to command mode.

Left Arrow (Ctrl-S)

     Moves the cursor one column left.

Right Arrow (Ctrl-D)

     Moves the cursor one column right.

Up Arrow (Ctrl-E)

     Moves the cursor one row up. If the cursor is at the top of the
     screen, the text is scrolled down.

Down Arrow (Ctrl-X)

     Moves the cursor one row down. If the cursor is at the bottom of the
     screen, the text is scrolled up.

Home (Ctrl-L)

     Moves the cursor to the start of the line, or to the end if the cursor
     was already on the start column.

Ctrl-T

     Moves the cursor to the top line of the screen, or to the bottom one
     if the cursor already was on the top line.

Ctrl-F

     Moves the cursor to the next tab stop.

Ctrl-Q

     Moves the cursor to the previous tab stop.

Tab (Ctrl-I)

     Inserts a tab character.

Return or Enter (Ctrl-M)

     Splits the line at the current cursor location and moves the cursor
     to the start of the next line.

Ctrl-R or Ctrl-_

     Redraws the screen.

Ctrl-Y or Ctrl-^

     Delete current line, shifting the lines below it one row up.

LF (Ctrl-J)

     Inserts an empty line below the current one. The cursor is moved down
     to the new line, same column.

Ctrl-K

     Inserts an empty line at the current cursor position, shifting the
     existing text one row down. The cursor remains on the same location.

DEL or Backspace (Ctrl-H)

     Delete char left, shifting the rest of the line one column left.

Ctrl-] or Ctrl-G

     Delete character right, shifting the rest of the line one column left.

Ctrl-P

     Duplicates the current line. The new line is placed below the current
     one, shifting any existing text one row down.

Ctrl-V

     Toggle insert/overwrite mode. Default editing mode is overwrite, where
     typed characters overwrite the existing text. In insert mode, the text
     on the line is shifted one column to the right starting from the cursor
     position before the typed character is stored.

Ctrl-B or Ctrl-N

     Enter "browse" mode. The cursor jumps to the bottom of the screen,
     below the ruler and the number to the right shows the line number the
     cursor was on. In browse mode the cursor movement keys work as
     described below:

     Left Arrow (Ctrl-S)

          Shift screen window 10 columns left (the text appears to move 10
          columns right).

     Right Arrow (Ctrl-D)

          Shift screen window 10 columns right (the text appears to move
          10 columns left).

     Up Arrow (Ctrl-E)

          Shift screen window 21 lines up (the text appears to scroll 21
          lines down, so the top line becomes the bottom one).

     Down Arrow (Ctrl-X)

          Shift screen window 21 lines down (the text appears to scroll 21
          lines up, so the bottom line becomes the top one).

     Ctrl-C, Ctrl-Z or Return exits browse mode.
