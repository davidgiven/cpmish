Virtual Memory structures used by TED
-------------------------------------

The code and the descriptions below use the following naming conventions:

  1 block  = 1 disk sector = 512 bytes
  1 record = 16 bytes, there are 32 records in a block

Text lines are stored internally in a double-linked list of records with the
following format:

  Head record:
    +------+------+------+----------------------------------+
    | cont | next | prev | text, 10 chars max               |
    +------+------+------+----------------------------------+

  Continuation record:
    +------+------+------+----------------------------------+
    | cont | text, 14 chars max                             |
    +------+------+------+----------------------------------+

  Free list record:
    +------+------------------------------------------------+
    | next | unused                                         |
    +------+------------------------------------------------+

The continuation field is set to zero for the last record in a sequence.

Similarly, the prev and next fields set to zero indicate end of the list.

The text field ends with a CR, which is stored only if there are less chars
than the maximum (i.e. a single overflowing CR is never stored in a new
record).

Spaces are compressed into a byte with the high bit set and the lower 7 bits
indicating the actual number of spaces.

Since record numbers are kept in a word, the maximum work file size (and
therefore the maximum editable file size) is limited to 65536/32 = 2048
blocks, or about 2048*512 = 1048576 bytes (1 Mbyte). In practice, the
maximum file size is somewhat less than that due to the overhead of pointers
(one word per record) and length fields (one additional word in the line
header records). In compensation, multiple contiguous spaces get compressed
into a single byte.

The maximum allowed line length is 162 bytes.

Buffers for blocks in memory are allocated from top of memory down and
are 516 bytes long (2 words + 32 records of 16 bytes). The first two words
contain:

  1. (offset 0): LRU count (low 15 bits), high bit set = 'dirty'
  2. (offset 2): block number, used to index into the block map area

Block map grows from low memory up, and has a max size of 2048 bytes.
A value of zero indicates that the block has been swapped out, while a
non-zero value points to the buffer containing the block in memory. Note
that since 64K can only hold up to 128 buffers (65536/512 = 128), one byte
is enough to represent buffer numbers in memory.
