; ===============================================
; CAMEL80D.AZM: CPU and Model Dependencies
;   Source code is for the Z80MR macro assembler.
;   Forth words are documented as follows:
;*   NAME     stack -- stack    description
;   Word names in upper case are from the ANS
;   Forth Core word set.  Names in lower case are
;   "internal" implementation words & extensions.
;
; Direct-Threaded Forth model for Zilog Z80
;   cell size is   16 bits (2 bytes)
;   char size is    8 bits (1 byte)
;   address unit is 8 bits (1 byte), i.e.,
;       addresses are byte-aligned.
; ===============================================

; ALIGNMENT AND PORTABILITY OPERATORS ===========
; Many of these are synonyms for other words,
; and so are defined as CODE words.

;X COMPILE,  xt --         append execution token

; it is defined in the ANSI standard as COMPILE,.

; CONTROL STRUCTURES ============================
; These words allow Forth control structure words
; to be defined portably.

;Z ,BRANCH   xt --    append a branch instruction
; xt is the branch operator to use, e.g. qbranch
; or (loop).  It does NOT append the destination
; address.  On the Z80 this is equivalent to ,XT.
    head COMMABRANCH,7,',BRANCH',docode
        jp COMMA

;Z ,DEST   dest --        append a branch address
; This appends the given destination address to
; the branch instruction.  On the Z80 this is ','
; ...other CPUs may use relative addressing.
    head COMMADEST,5,',DEST',docode
        jp COMMA

;Z !DEST   dest adrs --    change a branch dest'n
; Changes the destination address found at 'adrs'
; to the given 'dest'.  On the Z80 this is '!'
; ...other CPUs may need relative addressing.
    head STOREDEST,5,'!DEST',docode
        jp STORE

; HEADER STRUCTURE ==============================
; The structure of the Forth dictionary headers
; (name, link, immediate flag, and "smudge" bit)
; does not necessarily differ across CPUs.  This
; structure is not easily factored into distinct
; "portable" words; instead, it is implicit in
; the definitions of FIND and CREATE, and also in
; NFA>LFA, NFA>CFA, IMMED?, IMMEDIATE, HIDE, and
; REVEAL.  These words must be (substantially)
; rewritten if either the header structure or its
; inherent assumptions are changed.
